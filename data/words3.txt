ABOUT
EMERALD
DEITY
1:
\r\n\r\nThis
is
an
ENERGIZED
HOLISTIC
TOOL,
consisting
of
a
genuine,
quality
emerald
set
in
14K
solid
gold
over
a
natural
clear
phantom
QUARTZ
crystal.
The
crystal
is
a
rare
beauty,
with
a
pyramid
phantom
tucked
right
beneath
the
gold
setting.
The
setting
allows
light
to
go
through
the
emerald
for
greater
brightness
and
reflection.
\r\n\r\nThis
crytal
has
multiple
uses
and
can
be
worn
for
energy
balancing,
or
used
for
healing,
meditation,
reiki,
radionics,
and
other
holistic
uses.\r\n\r\nEmerald
is
associated
in
the
Vedic
system
with
the
planet
Mercury.
Mercury
is
associated
with
communications,
among
many
other
things.
The
Vedas
are
probably
the
oldest
knowledge
in
the
world
and
they
encompass
all
walks
of
life
and
areas
of
human
knowledge.
Vedic
knowledge
is
at
the
foundation
of
modern
Hinduism
and
if
not
the
foundation,
then
a
great
influence
on
other
religions
as
well,
including
Buddhism.\r\n\r\nTHE
UNIQUE
NATURE
OF
THIS
ITEM:\r\n\r\nThis
item
has
Multiple
Functions:
Ceremonial
Tool,
Holistic
Transceiver,
Talisman,
Amulet
and
Pendant.
It
is
a
unique
combination
of
a
precious
gem,
a
very
nice
quality
emerald,
and
an
unusual,
beautifully
clear
phantom
quartz
crystal
point
with
a
perfectly
shaped
pyramid
phantom
in
the
center.
It
is
set
in
thick,
14K,
solid
gold.
\r\n\r\nThis
item
is
a
holistic
tool
designed
so
that
it
could
be
worn
as
a
talisman,
amulet
and
pendant,
if
desired.\r\n\r\nNone

Fall

gothic
fantasy
art
print
by
Jasmine
Becket-Griffith
8x10
***Details:
\r\n\r\nA
beautiful
8&quot;x10&quot;
fine
art
fantasy
print!
This
is
a
professional
print
made
from
my
original
acrylic
painting,
and
is
on
glossy
photo
paper.
The
print
measures
8.5&quot;x11&quot;
including
a
white
mounting
border
for
ease
of
matting,
framing,
or
just
hanging
by
itself!
It
will
fit
a
standard
8&quot;x10&quot;
frame.
I
would
be
happy
to
sign
or
personalize
your
print,
front
or
back
at
your
request
=)
It
has
a
great
deal
of
detail
in
it,
and
it
is
far
lovelier
in
real
life
than
in
the
low-quality
scan.
The
copyright
watermark
is
just
for
the
auction,
itâs
not
in
the
actual
print!
It
may
have
been
cropped
or
discoloured
slightly
by
my
scanner.
I
hope
you
enjoy
looking
at
it,
and
maybe
even
adding
it
to
your
collection.
It
has
a
great
deal
of
detail
in
it,
and
the
colours
are
considerably
brighter
in
real
life
than
in
the
low-quality
scan.
You
are
bidding
on
beautiful
fine
art
print
by
fantasy
artist
Jasmine
Becket-Griffith
(aka
Strangeling).
\r\n\r\n***About
the
Artist:\r\n\r\nMy
name
is
Jasmine
Becket-Griffith.
I
am
26
years
old
and
I
live
in
beautiful
Celebration,
Florida.
I
am
a
full-time
artist
and
I
make
my
living
selling
my
artwork.
I
have
been
selling
my
original
Fairy,
Gothic,
and
Fantasy
artwork
online
for
about
8
years
now.
I
am
a
self-representing
artist,
and
you
are
purchasing
this
artwork
directly
from
me,
the
artist.
I
feel
that
it
is
important
for
me
to
sell
my
work
directly
to
my
fans,
without
the
needless
expenses
or
pretension
of
a
gallery
or
middleman.
\r\n\r\nI
grow
weary
of
the
mundane
world,
and
I
am
trying
to
slowly
create
my
own
through
my
fantasy
artwork.
I
believe
that
with
each
piece
of
art
I
get
out
of
my
system,
onto
paper,
and
into
your
home
I
have
done
my
part
to
make
this
place
a
more
magical
planet.
\r\n\r\nYou
may
have
seen
my
artwork
featured
in
new
lines
of
clothing
and
other
merchandise
being
sold
in
thousands
of
retail
stores
across
the
country,
in
places
like
Hot
Topic,
Torrid,
etc.
Some
of
the
paintings
&
prints
that
I
am
selling
here
on
etsy
are
the
very
images
that
will
be
licensed
for
these
products.
Here
is
your
chance
to
own
the
actual
artwork!\r\n\r\nMy
work
can
be
found
in
collections
and
galleries
throughout
the
world,
and
am
featured
in
the
books
&quot;The
Art
of
Faery&quot;
&
&quot;The
World
of
Faery&quot;
now
in
stores!
I
was
also
selected
to
have
my
artwork
appear
in
&quot;Spectrum
11&quot;
and
the
new
&quot;Spectrum
13&quot;!
Also
be
sure
to
check

prewash
the

detergent
to
reduce
shrinkage

soft
denim
straps
are
easy
on
your

No
cheap
webbing
here.
There
are
4
ironing
steps
and
the
tote
is
sewn
on
a
serger
for
that
professional
look
that
will
last
and
last.
We
are
in
our
7th
year
of
making
these
totes
and
have
thousands
of
satisfied
customers,
many
of
which
come
back
again
and
again.
Many
have
seen
us
at
craft
shows
like
Sharp&#39;s
at
War
Eagle
and
downtown
Branson
Mo.
You
won&#39;t
be
disappointed
in
this

And
it&#39;s
even

Beaded
Art
Doll
Olivia
Pearl
is
the
latest
of
my
beaded
art
dolls.She
is
approximately
5
1\\\\/2&quot;
tall
and
2
1\\\\/2&quot;
wide.
I
used
green
colored
20
gauge
copper
wire
to
form
the
doll
shape,
and
thinner
26
gauge
green\\\\/gold
colored
copper
wire
to
adorn
her.Her
head
is
a
large
faux
pearl
topped
with
a
glass
bead.
I
used
olive
green
czech
glass
seed
&
bugle
beads
to
form
her
arms,
&
her
hands
are
pretty
olive
glass
rounds
that
are
highlighted
with
pink,
blue
&
yellow.
The
focal
beads
in
her
body
are
various
pink
&
olive
glass
beads.
The
rest
of
her
body
alternates
with
olive
seeds
&
bugles.
Lastly,
her
legs
are
spiraled
with
seed
beads
&
end
in
pink
glass
cubes
&
transparent
glass
leaves.
\r\n\r\nI
formed
a
hanger
on
top
of
her
head.
Just
think
how
beautiful
she
will
look
hanging
in
a
sunny
window,
on
a
mirror,
or
on
yourself!\r\n\r\n

baby
pants
have
elastic
waist
and
big

pockets.
I
make
them
with
extra
long
legs,
which
means
baby
can
wear
them
for
much
longer
than
regular

since
babies
waists
don’t
grow
nearly
as
fast
as
their

Just

up
the

for

The

is

up.

I
recently
purchased
a
large
amount
of
Vintage
Findings
from
an
estage
sale
of
a
jewelry
designer,
c.1940&#39;s.
I
have
quite
a
few
of
this
particular
brass
finding
stamping,
which
I
have
decided
to
share,
since
I
have
more
than
I
can
use.
So,
don&#39;t
let
this
one
pass
you
by,
quantities
are
limited.\r\n
Excellent
quality
with
a
rich
patina.
\r\n\r\nEach
measure
approx.
2
1/4&quot;
x
2
1/4&quot;.\r\n\r\nShipping

$1.
I
am
happy
to
combine
multiple
purchases
for
one
shipping
costs.
Just
let
me
know
when
you
are
finished
shopping.
Thank
you.\r\n\r\nPlease
remember
this
is
for
only
ONE
finding.

Skeins)
The
flaming
colors
of
a
maple
tree
in
autumn
saturate
these
two
handpainted
skeins
of
70%
wool,
30%
superfine
alpaca.
This
listing
is
for
both
bulky
weight
skeins
from
the
same
handpainting
session.
These
flaming
colors
were
a
bit
difficult
to
photograph,
even
in
natural
light.
Photograph

is
perhaps
closest
to
the
actual
colors:
crimsony
orange,
gold,
and
light
browns.

To

in

(hat,

you
can

Hello
to
Summer
--

Who
doesn&#39;t
miss
those
sunny
days
napping
with
warm
sand
between
your
toes?
\r\n\r\nI
took
this
photograph
at
at
Onslow
Beach,
Camp
Lejune,
NC
a
few
years
ago.
I
took
it
with
a
Holga
camera
which
explain
the
vingetting,
distortion,
and
light
leaks.
I
love
the
result!\r\n\r\nThis
is
a
borderless
black
and
white
5x7
photo
printed
on
true
photo
(matte)
paper
by
a
professional
lab.
Unmatted,
unframed.\r\n\r\nThe
first
picture
is
to
show
detail
and
so
that
the
thumb
looks
good!
the
second

taking
a

I
Have
the
Midnight
Blues
Howlite
Teardrop
Necklace
This
17&quot;
necklace
features
lovely
shades
of
blue!
The
1&quot;
turquoise
howlite
teardrop
pendant
is
complemented
by
matching
howlite
beads
and
Indian
glass
beads,
while
midnight
blue
seed
beads
finish
up
the
design
nicely.
This
necklace
would
look
equally
great
with
a
floaty
summer
skirt
or
a
chunky
winter
sweater--versatile!
\r\n\r\nIf
you&#39;re
an
Aries
like
me,
you
might
find
that
howlite
helps
calm
you
on
those
stubborn,
headstrong
days
(yeah,
you
fellow
Arians
know
what
I&#39;m
talking
about...).\r\n\r\nHowlite
is
not
naturally
bright--it
is
dyed
to
achieve
its
turquoise
hue.
\r\n\r\nI
will
combine
shipping
costs
for
multiple
purchases--please
e-mail
me
before
paying
for
new
cost
(one
extra
item
incurs
no
extra
cost,
2
or
more
may
depending
on

MY
APPLIQUES:
I
am
inspired
by
everyday
materials.
Sponges,
gripmats,
easywipes...Things
that
we
use
everyday
and
we
throw
away...I
want
whatever
I
make
to
speak
about
the
time
we
live,
a
time
of
waste
and
excess.
This
is
my
prime
interest
and
impulse
to
create
and
it
is
challenging
and
fun.
All
the
appliques
are
cut
by
me
and
hand
stitched
on
the
tees(
most
of
them
)\r\nI
love
to
use
my
hands
and
create
something
and
I
love
the
concept
of
not
repeating
myself.
It
isn&#39;t
about
profit
or
industrial
production
it
is
about
bringing
back
a
different
value
to
clothes
and
life.\r\nthanks

Golden
Sands
Sunstone
and
Pearl
Pendant
The
feature
stone
in
this
is
an
almost
indescribable
color
of
pinkish
brown
with
golden
flecks
in
it.
It
is
accented
with
2
pale
mauve
freshwater
pearls.
The
pendant
measures
1
1/2&quot;
in
length.\r\n\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\r\nThis
design
was
born
out
of
an
attempt
to
emulate
a
design
I&#39;d
seen
but
for
which
there
were
no
tutorials
available.
Those
that
did
these
designs
form
a
tight
community
and
were
not
free
with
tips
nor
techniques.
So,
armed
with
wire,
I
decided
to
come
up
with
my
own
version,
while
similar
in
look
to
others
you
may
see,
I
can
assure
you
that
these
are
my
original
designs,
unique
in
creation,
all
starting
out
in
similar
fashion,
however
as
they
progress,
they
take
on
a
life
of
their
own.
Often
the
creative
process
takes
several
days
as
I
pause
to
contemplate
the
next
step,
the
finished
product
always
turning
out
differently
than
planned,
yet
perfect
in
it&#39;s
own
right.
Well
constructed,
beautiful
and
natural
stones,
pieces
of
art

wear
and

lots

silver

&
body
parts,
all
hung
on

She

depending
on
her

shimmy.
They

They

They

They
make

smile.
They’re
the
BDs,
fresh
from
the
hands
&
brain
of
Leslie
Sirag,
whose
art
crafts
have
been
exhibited
in
shows
&
galleries
from
New
York
to
California.
Now
working
from
her
home
in
Washington
State,
Leslie
produces
these
little
charmers
one
at
a
time
&
each
is
an
individual
character
who
will
never
be
duplicated,
although
the
nature
of
the
materials
does
mean
that
some
pieces
will
be
similar.
\r\n\r\nMost
of
the
BDs,
like
this
one,
are
pins,
though
some
are
bookmarks
or
magnets.
(All
but
the
magnets
can
easily
be
converted
to
pendants
if
desired.)
They
can
be
worn,
hang
outside
a
book,
or
decorate
a
refrigerator,
but
can
also
easily
hang
from
curtains,
lampshades,
metal
file
cabinets,
or
anything
else
metal
or
with
a
knob
or
clip.
They
range
in
height
from
about
4
to
6
inches.

is
one
of
a
set
of
eighteen
beautiful,
graceful,
huge
REAL
STAINED

glass
angels
(not
plastic,
not

I

in

of
all
ages
love
these
angels!
Your
fairy
princess
daughter,
sister,
wife,
mother,
niece,
aunt,
grandmother
or
friend
would
welcome
one
or
two
of
these
collectible
treasures
for
any
gifting
occasion.
Or
buy
them
for
yourself!\r\n\r\nEach
angel
is
nineteen
inches
tall
(one
and
one
half
feet!)
And
of
freeform
stained
glass
copper
foil
construction.
Both
sides
are
finished
with
a
stippled
texture
on
all
solder
lines
and
have
solder
eyes.
The
stippling
adds
extra
shine,
light
reflection,
and
richness
to
the
overall
piece
of
art.
Spectrum
wispy
glass
was
used
to
supply
the
yummy
hair
and
gown
colors.\r\n\r\nA
one
foot
length
of
jack
hanging
chain
is
attached.
Caution:
Never
hang
an
angel
by
a
chain
which
is
in
an
inverted
V
configuration.
It
will
stress
the
piece
and
may
cause
buckling.\r\n

Baby
Girl&#39;s
First
Christmas
Ornament
Puzzle
Ball
You
may
have
seen
balls
that
look
like
this
one
before...but
this
one
is
a
puzzle.
It
comes
apart
in
three
pieces.
I
started
sewing
these
by
hand
several
years
ago
to
give
as
baby
gifts,
then
decided
to
reduce
them
to
Christmas
ornament
size.
This
is
about
2
3\\\\/4&quot;
in
diameter,
made
of
cotton
fabric
and
polyester
stuffing,
every
stitch
by
hand.\r\n\r\nThis
is
a
special
Baby&#39;s
First
Christmas
ornament
for
girls.
\r\n\r\nThis
ornament
is
perfect
for
a
house
with
pets
or
little
kids
because
they
cannot
be
broken
and
if
they
get
dirty
you
can
just
throw
them
in
the
washing
machine.
Kids
will
like
having
a
special
ornament
on
the
tree
just
that&#39;s
all
their
own
and
they&#39;ll
delight
in
showing
the
rest
of
the
family
how
to
take
it
apart
and
put
the
puzzle
back
together.\r\n\r\nLarger
sizes
are
available
that
are
great
toys
for
babies
and
children.
Check
my
other
listings
or
contact
me
for
special
orders.\r\n\r\nI&#39;ll
be
happy
to
ship
internationally!
Just
convo
me
and
I&#39;ll
figure
out
the
accurate
shipping
to
wherever
you
are
and
get
right
back
to
you.\r\n\r\nYou
can
see
photos
of
how
these
puzzles
are
assembled

You
are
looking
at
one
hand
knit
GRAPE
baby&#39;s
hat.
\r\n\r\nThis
will
be
custom
made
for
your
little
one.
The
color
in
the
pictures
do
not
reflect
the
true
color
-
it
is
hard
to
get
the
right
color.
The
darkest
picture
is
more
of
a
true
color
but
the
grape
is
even
darker
than
that.
\r\n\r\nAt
the
end
of
the
listing
and
after
payment
has
been
made
you
will
indicate
what
size
it
is
that
you
need.
This
hat
will
be
knit
either
by
myself
or
my
mother.
We
are
a
knitting
and
crocheting
team.
\r\n\r\nWe
have
made
many
of
these
and
decided
to
list
on
etsy.
.
This
comes
from
a
smoke
free
and
pet
free
home.
The
hats
come
in
sizes
preemie,
0-3
months,
3-6
months
1
years
old.
\r\n\r\nWe
suggest
hand
washing
in
cold
water.
\r\n\r\nitems
will

wish

add
the

that
you
want
it

to

Morrisonite
Wire
Wrapped
Pendant
with
Chain
ps100
I
made
this
pendant
by
wrapping
a
Morrisonite
jasper
stone
in
sterling
silver
wire.
The
stone
measures
23mm
by
46mm,
and
it
is
a
freeform
cut,
roughly
oval
in
shape.
It
has
a
beautiful
and
unique
pattern
of
yellows,
reds,
and
browns.
The
pendant
measures
just
shy
of
2
1\\\\/2
inches
(62mm)
in
overall
length.
It
is
one
of
my
larger
pendants.\r\n\r\nThis
pendant
comes
with
a
1.5mm
sterling
silver
diamond-cut
curb
chain.

This
little
holder
is
a
great
way
to
keep
recipe
cards
upright
while
trying
to
read
them,
and
works
well
at
your
desk,
too,
when
trying
to
read
something
while
typing.
I
made
it
out
of
a
lump
of
porcelain
and
used
a
ruler
to
make
an
indentation
to
hold
a
card.
It&#39;s
2&quot;
tall
x
4&quot;
across
and
was
glazed
in
a
pretty
butter
yellow.
It&#39;s
signed
on
the
bottom.

Antique
Copper
Ball
Necklace
This
necklace
is
made
up
of
8
filagree
copper
balls
that
I
picked
up
on
EBay
a
year
or
two
ago.
They
are
very
unique.
The
toggle
is
also
copper.
The
wire
connecting
everything
is
copper-colored
and
silver.
Each
ball
has
a
pink
glass
bead
on
either
side
of
it.
This
necklace
is
25
inches
long
and
is
one
of
a
kind!

I
think
I
would
have
fun
making
these
Circle
beads
every
hour
of
the
day.
Yeah,
I
don&#39;t
know
what
it
is
about
circles,
wait,
are
we
made
up
of
circles
(cells?)
Yeah,
maybe
these
are
single
celled
organisms
strung
on
elastic
cord
along
with
inanimate
spheres.
Whatever
they
are,
they
will
sure
grab
your
attention
on
a
cold
gray
day.\r\n\r\nThere&#39;s
lots
of
fun
colors
on
these
handmade
polymer
beads.
This
design
reveals
a
little
bit
of
the
playful
and
limitless
aspects
of
bead-making.
It
measures
approx.
7.5
in.
and
beads
are
strung
on
high-quality
elastic
cord.

Invitation
Set
of
6
Elegant
art
cards,
handmade
and
signed
by
the
artist.
Set
of
6
assorted
art
cards
in
6
different
celestial
designs.
Each
is
lithographed
with
gold
foil
on
a
textured
paper,
then
applied
to
parchment
card
stock
and
tied
with
gold
braid
cord.
These
are
suitable
for
framing
and
handcrafted
of
recycled
papers.
Perfect
for
fine
invitations,
occasions
or
gifts,
the
interior
is
blank
for
your
own
message.
The
cards
are
folded
to
4.5&quot;x6&quot;
and
each
comes
with
a
descriptive
insert
in
a
cellophane
sleeve.\r\n\r\nLITHOGRAPHIC
PRINTS
-
The
cards
shown
in
this
shop
were
produced
with
&quot;old
school&quot;
methods
of
graphic
design
and
illustration.
They
are
examples
pulled
from
the
shelves
of
my
hand
made
card
line
and
there
are
limited
quantities
remaining.\r\n\r\nThe
concepts
and
pre-press
artwork
were
created
by
hand,
then
taken
to
a
high
quality
print
shop
where
metal
plates
and
dies
were
produced
for
gold
foil
and
lithographic
printing
on
textured
papers.
The
pieces
were
then
individually
assembled,
and
in
some
cases
painted,
by
hand
to
create
beautiful
miniature
works
of
art.
The
final
piece
has
a
lot
of
substance
and
is
simply
not
reproduceable
digitally.\r\n\r\nThe
copyright
watermark
is
used
only
on
internet

Wire
Brain
Sculpture
The
brain
is
an
amazing,
amazing
thing.
\r\nThe
way
it
holds
all
those
memories,
the
way
time
can
morph
them.
The
way
the
brain
can
just
decide
to
forget
them
all
and
leave
a
person
knowing
no
one,
not
even
themselves.
Or
how
you
just
know
how
to
breathe
without
ever
having
to
learn
or
think
about
it.
\r\nI’m
pretty
sure
if
you
crack
open
my
brain,
it
will
be
filled
with
paper
too.
\r\n\r\nI
constructed
this
brain
over
many
weeks
with
steel
and
copper
wires
of
varying
gauges
as
well
as
some
super
thin
wire
I
found
when
stripping
wires
from
my
old
computer.
\r\n\r\nThe
brain
is
filled
with
all
kinds
of
memories.
Inside
you’ll
find
various
papers,
some
from
my
dad’s
college
notebooks,
picture
negatives,
reel
to
reel
tape
and
love.

The
Little
Flower
Silver
Lamp
Glass
Ring
Was
$38.00,
but
I&#39;m
clearing
my
inventory
to
make
room
for
new
items.\r\n\r\nThis
is
a
size
5
silver
and
lamp
glass
ring.\r\n\r\nWhile
I
was
prowling
around
a
library
book
sale
once,
I
stumbled
across
a
tiny
little
book
with
delicate
etchings
on
its
front
cover.
The
title
was
“The
Little
Flowers.”
The
diminutive
book
caught
my
eye
and
I
immediately
became
captivated
by
it.
It
was
enormously
powerful
for
such
a
little
thing!\r\n\r\nLeaving
through
its
delicate
onionskin
pages,
I
came
to
realize
that
it
was
a
book
written
by
Francis
of
Assisi.
I
knew
nothing
about
Francis,
but
on
reading
the
book
I
felt
an
immediate
kinship.
All
my
life
I’ve
loved
animals.
When
I
was
12,
chipmunks
used
to
eat
out
of
my
hands.
My
cat
Oreo
and
my
dog
Hooligan
both
curl
up
on
my
lap
every
night,
and
my
ferret
Jillian
is
my
“littlest
girlfriend.”\r\n\r\nAnyway,
the
inspiration
for
this
ring
is
St.
Francis,
who
was
an
extraordinarily
humble
soul
and
whom
I
want
to
emulate.
I
hope
some
of
the
joy
I
felt
making
this
ring
infuses
with
gentleness
and
peace
the
person
who
chooses
to
own
it.\r\n

\r\n\r\n---
the
back
story\r\n\r\nThere
was
a
very
worn
and
fragile
vintage
barkcloth
knitting
bag
at
the
local
Antique
Mall
-
oh
I
fell
for
it
hard.
Kept
going
to
visit
it,
just
looking
and
soaking
in
the
ambiance,
never
measuring;
one
day
set
out
to
create
my
own
version
to
convert
into
a
purse.
So
from
memory
drew
up
a
pattern
and
made
it
up
in
wool.
Took
that
first
one
into
the
Antique
Mall
and
Yahoo!
had
come
pretty
close.
Enjoyed
that
first
bag
so
much
have
made
others
from
time
to
time.
This
being
one.
*
And
eventually
did
buy
the
original
and
keep
it
for
display
and
as
a
great
memory
of
how
inspiration
can
hit.\r\n\r\n---------\r\n\r\nQuestions
welcome,
am
happy
to
provide
more
detail
if
desired.\r\n\r\nAlso
happy
to
send

Mixed
Media
Encaustic
collage
Childish
Thoughts
series
This
is
an
original
mixed
media
collage
and
painting
in
a
9X7
shadowbox
(yes...it
did
once
hold
cigars,
how
did
you
guess?)
\r\n\r\nThe
outside
of
the
box
is
treated
with
a
corroded
bronze
finish
that
will
continue
to
age.\r\n\r\nThis
is
part
of
my
&quot;Childish
Thoughts&quot;
series.\r\n\r\nThe
poem
reads:
\r\n\r\nI
cannot
do
the
big
things\r\nThat
I
should
like
to
do,\r\nTo
make
the
earth
for
ever
fair,\r\nThe
sky
for
ever
blue.\r\n
\r\nBut
I
can
do
the
small
things\r\nThat
help
to
make
it
sweet;\r\nTho&#39;
clouds
arise
and
fill
the
skies,\r\nAnd
tempests
beat.
\r\n\r\nEvery
piece
is
signed
and
dated
on
the
rear...(hehehe)\r\n\r\nThe
piece
incorporates
acrylics,
beeswax
based
encaustics,
oils,
graphite
pencil,
handmade
papers,
vintage
photos,
and
a
lovely
(if
somewhat
disturbing
poem).
All
elements
are
adheard
with
beeswax....so
mind
it.\r\n\r\nThe
encaustics
give
my
work
a
lovely
sense
of
depth.
My
tile
artist
pal
says
that
it
makes
her
want
to
eat
my
work...
but

\r\nArt

Its
not

its
who
I
am!
Through
35
years
of
ups
and
downs
art
has
been
the
one
constant
in
my
life.
\r\nMy
professional
Art
career
began
in
March
1991
shortly
after
the
birth
of
my
second
son.
My
hope
was
to
earn
the
part
time
paycheck
I
needed
to
be
a
stay
at
home
mom.
Fourteen
years
later,
Ive
sold
many
drawings
and
paintings
and
thousands
of
prints
all
over
the
world!
Thanks
to
all
the
wonderful
people
who
have
supported
and
purchased
my
art,
my
dream
has
become
a
reality!
When
I
began
14
years
ago,
all
sales
happened
on
the
road,
there
was
no
internet
to
connect
me
to
the
world.
Although
I
still
show
in
Galleries
and
sell
prints
in
shops,
most
of
my
sales
happen
online.
Welcome
to
the
future!
The
best
benefit
to
this
outlet
is
that
I
get
the
privilege
of
dealing
directly
with
the
people
who
hang
my
art
on
their
walls!
\r\nI
live
in
Albuquerque,
New
Mexico
only
a
couple
hours
from
my
hometown,
Las
Cruces.
I
live
with
my
husband
Aaron,
youngest
son
Nate
and
three
dogs
in
a
great
house
about
half
a
mile
from
the
Rio
Grande
River.
Youll
find
us
walking
along
the
Bosque
(area
of
trees
around
the
river)
most
sunny
afternoons.
I
spend
my
days
(and
some
nights)
working
in
my
home
studio,
connected
to
the
world
by
internet.
I
am
also
an
active
member
of
the
Albuquerque
artist
community.
In
2004
I
co-founded
Seventh
Mountain
Artists,
a
group
of
Albuquerque
artists
that
originally
met
as
art
studio
tenants
at
the
Harwood
Art
Center.
\r\nI
currently
work
mainly
in
watercolor,
but
I
have
worked
with
a
variety
of
mediums.
I
like
to
paint
a
fairly
large
variety
of
subject
matter
but
stick
mainly
to
southwest
landscapes,
portraits
and
my
newest
fascination,
abstract
expressionism!
Recently,
my
main
theme
has
been
peace.
I
hope
to
make
my
mark
on
the
world
by
spreading
my
message
of
Peace
on
Earth.
I
truly
believe
if
everyone
did
their
part,
it
could
be
a
peaceful
world
for
our
children
and
grandchildren.

Tag

“A
journey
of
a
thousand
miles
begins
with
a
single
step.”
\r\nConfucius
–
philosopher
\r\n\r\npaperplanet
Life
Journeys
are
handcrafted
using
2
–
5
recycled
luggage
tags.
\r\nEach
tag
measures
2&quot;
x
3
¾&quot;.
\r\nBoth
sides
of
each
tag
are
covered
with
different
and
unique
handmade
or
imported
papers.\r\n\r\nThe
quote
on
this
Life
Journeys
Tag
Hanging
is
\r\n“Yesterday
is
history,
tomorrow
is
a
mystery,
today
is
a
present”.\r\n\r\nEach
luggage
tag
is
embellished
with
a
variety
of
pressed
naturals
such
as
flowers,
petals,
leaves,
greenery,
and
small
roots.
Some
tags
may
include
small
images,
vintage
postage
stamps,
fibers,
charms
(such
as
angels,
keys,
butterflies),
feathers,
metal
nail
heads,
or
Chinese
coins.\r\n\r\nAll
Life
Journeys
include
at
least
one
tag
with
a
circular
opening
or
‘window’.
\r\nInside
the
opening
may
be
a
pressed
flower
or
an
image
that
has
been
mounted
on
handmade
paper,
a
bit
of
lace
or
tulle,
paper
lace,
Egyptian
papyrus.
\r\nLuggage
tags
may
include
gold
or
silver
leafing,
gold
or
silver
lettering,
or
tiny
faceted
jewels.\r\n\r\nOne
word
or
a
few
words
included
on
each
tag
impart
a
short
poem,
quotation,
inspiration,
or
sentiment
when
tags
are
read
from
top
to
bottom.
\r\nTags
are
joined
together
with
metallic
cords,
ribbons,
or
fibers.
Glass,
metal,
or
wooden
beads
threaded
on
the
cords
separate
each
tag.
The
joined
tags
are
suspended
from
a
5’
rustic
branch,
thin
bamboo,
rolled
bark
or
husk,
or
a
smooth
wooden
rod.
A
loop
of
cord,
ribbon,
or
fiber
at
the
top
allows
for
easy
hanging.\r\n\r\nLife
Journeys
are
lightweight
and
ready
to
hang
against
a
wall
or
free
flowing
so
that
the
tags
turn
in
the
slightest
air
current.
Though
both
sides
of
each
tag
are
embellished
differently,
the
sentiment
is
always
the
same.\r\n\r\nSize
-
approximately
13”
long
not
including
hanging
ribbon

Panda
Bear
Scissor
Fob
This
cute
little
panda
would
love
to
keep
watch
over
your
embroidery,
scrapbooking
or
other
small
scissors.\r\n\r\nMade
with
an
adorable
lampwork
panda
bear
bead
by
Etsy&#39;s
own
Avenue
Beads,
this
scissors
fob
will
make
your
scissors
stand
out
in
a
crowd.
It
will
also
help
to
protect
the
point
of
your
scissors
-
a
fob
is
made
to
be
heavier
than
the
scissors
so
it
pulls
the
scissors
handle
down
should
they
fall.
This
means
the
point
falls
last
and
in
a
flat
position.\r\n\r\nSCISSORS
ARE
NOT
INCLUDED!!!\r\n\r\nShipping
is
via
USPS
Priority
Mail.
I
will
combine
shipping
on
orders
placed
on
the
same
day.
I
generally
ship
Mondays,
Wednesdays
and
Fridays.\r\n\r\nReturns
are
accepted
within
7
days.
Buyer
must
notify
me
by
email
of
intent
to
return.
Purchase
price
will
be
refunded
upon

Simple
Pendant
Choker
(SPN-17)
I
designed
and
crafted
these
simple
beaded
chokers.
They
lie
against
your
neck
in
a
really
nice
way.
They
are
made
with
Silkon
bead
cord,
which
is
quite
durable,
and
imported
Czech
Republic
seedbeads.
And
they
are
adjustable,
with
a
silver-plated
chainwork
attached
to
a
silver
lobster-claw
clasp,
so
no
need
to
worry
about
getting
the
right
size.
Also,
a
percentage
of
my
profits
are
donated
to
the
World
Wildlife
Fund,
so
when
you
purchase
something
from
me,
you&#39;re
helping
to
protect
endangered
species
as
well.
My
special
interest
is
in
primate
protection,
hence
the
name!

Slouchy
Pink
and
Blue
Vintage
Spring
Bag
This
is
a
great
Spring
bag!
It
measures
about
12x17
in.
(including
handles),
is
fully
lined
in
a
coordinating
fabric,
and
includes
an
interior
pocket.
The
design
of
the
bag
is
unusual.
It
has
a
round
bottom
and
two
handles,
with
one
handle
being
longer
than
the
other.
The
fun
part
is
that
you
can
slip
the
longer
handle
through
the
shorter
one
and
the
bag
closes
up
and
hangs
perfectly
on
your
wrist
or
arm.
\r\n\r\nThis
bag
is
made
of
all
vintage
fabric.
The
outer
fabric
has
a
great
rosy
texture.
You
will
love
this
easy
to
carry
bag,
just
big
enough
for
all
your
necessary
stuff
without
being
too
heavy.
And
best
of
all,
you
just
grab
it
and
go!\r\n\r\nThis
bag
is
one
of
a
kind.
I
never
make
the
same
bag
twice.
If
you
have
any
questions,
please
let
me
know.
\r\n\r\nThank
you!\r\n

Pretty
but
Sad
Vintage
FRENCH
PURSE
for
Display
and
Rescue
Oh
but
this
pretty
little
purse
is
too
good
to
throw
away
but
not
good
enough
to
take
on
a
date.
It&#39;s
worn,
(see
photos),
the
inside
is
dirty,
and
the
clasp
doesn&#39;t
work.
I&#39;d
send
it
to
the
island
of
forgotten
purses,
but
it
doesn&#39;t
exist.\r\n\r\nIt&#39;s
good
points
are
its
beautiful
woven
fabric,
fancy
frame
with
flowers
and
filigree
clasp,
intact
chain
and
its
&quot;made
in
France&quot;
label.
I
would
guess
it
to
be
from
the
late
1930&#39;s.\r\n\r\nWouldn&#39;t
this
be
adorable
on
your
dresser
with
a
vintage
pair
of
gloves?
You
know
the
ones,
you
own
them,
they
are
too
small,
but
made
of
the
most
beautiful
kid.
This
purse
has
a
destiny.
Could
you
be
the
one
to
adopt
this
fabulous
purse?\r\n\r\nI
will
ship
to
countries
outside
the
United
States.
Please
contact
me
to
see
if
I
am
able
to
ship
to
yours!
Shipping
charges
will
be
based
on
country
and
weight.

mercerized
cotton.\r\n\r\nIt
fits
perfectly
on
my
22.5&quot;
head.\r\n\r\nThis
cap
needs
to
be
hand
washed
in
warm
water
and
rolled
in
a
towel
to
remove
excess
water.
I
recommend
a
styrofoam
head
to
dry
it
on.
This
extra
care
is
worth
it,
because
you&#39;ll
look
so
cute
in
this
cap!

Hemp
Cord
Choker\\\\/
Funky
and
Whimsical
(HPN-07)
All
of
these
chokers
are
made
of
hemp
cord.
Although
sometimes
hemp
can
be
scratchy,
this
particular
kind
is
polished
and
feels
soft
and
smooth
against
your
skin.
The
pendants
are
either
polished
glass,
semi-precious
stones
or
Swarovski
crystal.
They
are
adjustable;
I
have
attached
a
silver-plated
chain
to
a
lobster-claw
clasp,
so
you
are
able
to
adjust
it
to
the
exact
length
you
want.
And
don&#39;t
forget
that
for
every
purchase
you
make,
I
donate
a
percentage
to
the
World
Wildlife
Fund,
so
when
you&#39;re
making
a
purchase
from
me,
you&#39;re
also
advocating
for
the
protection
of
endangered
species.\r\n

Nereid
Sacred
Heart
Necklace
in
Abalone,
Mother
of
Pearl,
Aventurine,
Seaweed
Quartz,
Glass
and
Sterling
Silver
According
to
www.pantheon.org,
the
&quot;Nereids
are
the
fifty
daughters
of
Nereus
and
Doris
who
dwell
in
the
Mediterranean
Sea.
These
beautiful
women
were
always
friendly
and
helpful
towards
sailors
fighting
perilous
storms.
They
are
believed
to
be
able
to
prophesize.&quot;\r\n\r\nI
imagine
a
mermaid
with
flowing
hair,
scales
the
iridescent
hues
of
the
sea,
and
this
necklace
shining
in
the
sun,
reflecting
all
the
glory
of
the
sea.\r\n\r\nA
heart
of
laminated
abalone
and
mother-of-pearl
sits

flat
coins
of
exquisite
seaweed
quartz,
and
accented
with
iridescent
bronze
Czech
glass
in
faceted
3mm
rounds
and
seed
beads.
The
heart&#39;s
crowning
glory
is
a
handwoven
bail
of
sterling
silver
wire
and
Thai
fine
silver
beads
(adapted
from
an
Eni
Oken
tutorial).
Completing
this

Ebony
Rosary
These
black
barrel
beads
made
one
of
the
nicest
rosaries
I&#39;ve
made.
This
would
make
a
nice
gift
for
anyone
on
your
holiday
list.
The
rosary
beads
are
connected
end
to
end
by
individual
wires
I
cut
and
shape;
the
centuries
are
separated
by
five
chain
links.
I
used
a
hypoallergenic
silvertone
wire
inside
the
five
sections.
The
crucifix
and
Hail
Mary
Beads
are
imported
from
Italy.
The
&quot;Holy
Mother&quot;
center
is
a
relief
of
the
Holy
Mother
holding
Baby
Jesus.
On
the
reverse
side
is
a
relief
of
our
risen
Christ.
It
is
a
special
hand-crafted
charm
that
adds
a
lot
of
elegance
with
the
natural
beauty
of
the
shiny
black
beads.
The
silver
crucifix
is
also
imported
from
Italy
and
is
strikingly
beautiful
in
its
simplicity.
The
nails
are
shown
on
the
back
side
of
the
cross.
There
is
a
lot
of
emotion
showing
in
this
rosary
that
gives
it
a
lot
of
character.
I
hope
you
enyoy
this
special
work
of
art.
\r\n\r\nRosaries
are
not
jewelry.
This
has
not
been
blessed,
but
it
was
created
from
a
faithful
heart.

Buttons
\r\n----------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\nDear
Esty
folk,\r\n\r\nHere
are
three
(3)
red
apple,
handmade,
polymer
clay
buttons
handmade
by
me.\r\n\r\n\r\nThese
buttons
are
brand
new,
made
by
me.
They
could
be
an
excellent
addition
to
your
next
sewing
or
craft
project.
Some
of
my
buttons
up
for
sale
might
be
just
what
you
are
looking
for
to
add
to
your
latest
scrapbooking
project
or
to
add
the
finishing
touches
to
your
new
handmade
clothing
item.
You
could
even
revive
an
old
piece
of
clothing
with
these
new
decorations.\r\n\r\n\r\nThese
buttons
are
sold
&quot;as-is&quot;
so
please
take
a
look
at
the
photographs.
These
buttons
each
have
two
holes.
These
buttons
are
each
slightly
different
because
of
their
handmade
quality
but
are
roughly
2.1
cm
wide
and
1.7
cm
tall.\r\n\r\nCARE
-
I
would
only
recommend
a
gentle
hand-wash
of
any
garments
that
have
these
buttons
attached.\r\nThese
buttons
are
not
glazed.\r\nThe
Sculpey
website
says
-
&quot;Polymer
clay
buttons
(unless
first
coated
with
water
resistant
epoxy
glazes)
should
not
be
washed
in
a
conventional
washer
or
dried
in
a
dryer.
If
you
do
elect
to
wash
the
garment
with
the
buttons
remaining,
turn
the
garment
inside
out,
and
wash
on
a
gentle
cycle
or,
preferably,
by
hand.
Do
not
dry
clean
polymer
clay
buttons.&quot;\r\n\r\nThe
polymer
clay
used
to
make
these
is
non-toxic.\r\n\r\nPlease
feel
free
to
email
me
with
any
questions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKind
regards,\r\n\r\nGeorgia\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------\r\nPostage

original
painting
orange
urban
city
splatter
fluorescent
Hi!\r\nThis
is
an
original
16&quot;x20&quot;
acrylic
on
canvas
by
artist
Laura
Major
(me!).\r\nFrom
another
one
of
my
fits
of
rock
and
roll-induced
daydreaming
comes
this
psychotic
vision
of
a
stick
figuresque
city
drenched
in
thick
fluorescent
orange,
splattered
with
drips
of
white,
inscribed
with
strange
and
mysterious
calculations,
and
dissected
by
stairs
that
lead
to
nowhere
in
the
sky.\r\n\r\nI
tend
to
just
trance
out
and
keep
painting
maniacally
until
something
in
my
head
switches
and
I
know
it&#39;s
time
to
stop
and
the
painting
is
done.
All
of
my
works
are
dear
to
me
but
I
love
painting
to
much
that
I
have
to
sell
them
to
make
room
in
my
paint-splattered
apartment
for
more!\r\n\r\nThis
one
sure
pops
off
the
wall!
Looks
great
on
white
or
colored
backgrounds,
and
with
its
painted
sides
you
don&#39;t
even
need
a
frame.
\r\n\r\nHas
a
UV-deflecting
coating
to
prevent
fading.\r\n

Tatted

necklace
with
red
and
pink
beads
This
lovely
piece
of
jewelry
uses
the
Victorian
craft
of
tatting
in
a
contemporary
way.
My
original
design.\r\n\r\nThe
necklace
is
adjustable
from
about
17
inches
to
20
inches
by
hooking
the
lobster
claw
clasp
into
any
of
the
tatted
rings
at
the
other
end.
The
beads
are
glass,
and
the
thread
is
a
very
durable
6-cord
cotton.\r\n\r\n

Fairy
of
Earth
bookmark
A
winged
fairy
holds
an
acorn
on
a
branch,
symbolizing
the
element
of
Earth,
in
shades
of
gold,
copper,
and
brown.
The
entire
series
includes
Fairies
of
Air,
Fire,
Water,
and
Earth.\r\nThere
is
also
a
discounted
listing
any
four
bookmarks
with
free
shipping.
\r\n\r\nDisclaimer:
The
exact
item
shown
may
have
been
sold
already.
Two
different
copies
of
the
same
design
may
vary
slightly
in
colors
or
details.
But
the
design
shown
is
substantially
what
the
recipient
will
receive.
\r\n\r\n
Bookmarks
are
protected
in
clear
plastic
sleeves
measuring
8

by
2
½”
with
a
ribbon.

I
can
paint
any
papercut
bookmark
in
nearly
any
color.
A
bookmark
usually
“faces”
one
direction.
If
it
is
not
a
word
(like
“Peace”),
I
can
also
cut
the
design
to
face
the
other
direction.
Or
I
can
finish
it
with
a
ribbon
of
a
different
color.
Just
ask.
\r\n
These
papercuttings
are
my
original
design,
cut
from
paper,
painted
or
spray-painted.
Each
is
handmade,
and
I
don’t
like
to
cut
or
paint
them
exactly
alike,
so
each
varies
slightly.
The
back
of
each
bookmark
is
gold
and
signed
by
the
artist..
I
usually
have
a
few
of
each
design
on
hand,
or
I
can
make
another.

(original
painting,
matted,
unframed)
STORY:\r\nThis
painting
was
created
using
masking
fluid.
The
fluid
was
applied,
spelling
out
words
in
my
nightly
prayer.
I&#39;m
not
an
overly
religious
person,
certainly
not
a
&quot;pusher&quot;,
but
since
I
was
young
I&#39;ve
said
this
particular
rambling
compilation
of
prayers
superstitiously
before
falling
asleep.
After
I
wrote
the
words
out,
I
removed
the
masking
fluid
and
worked
on
the
painting
from
there.
\r\n\r\nThe
result
is
a
spiritual
and
bright
painting
with
lots
of
imbued
meaning.
Whether
you
choose
your
art
to
match
your
sofa
or
choose
your
art
for
its
meaning,
this
is
a
beautiful
and
significant
piece
of
artwork.
The
colors
are
lighter
and
brighter
in
person.\r\n\r\nTECHNICAL
DETAILS:\r\nThis
is
an
original

Kate
E.

painted
in
2006
on

This
is
a
sweet
little
journal
handmade
by
Christine
Phelps
of
Norfolk,
CT.
The
tag
indicates
it
was
made
from
recycled
and
salvaged
materials.
It
is
signed
&
dated
on
the
inside
back
cover:

1994,

1\\\\/1.\r\n\r\nThis
journal
is
6&quot;
by
6&quot;
in
size
and
has
a
sturdy
purple
front
cover
with
a
heart
design.
The
heart
is
copper
color
on
a
dark
blue
background;
the
dots
surrounding
the
heart
are,
I
believe,
light
blue
(sorry,
I&#39;m
old
and
my
eyes
aren&#39;t
that
great
these
days!).
This
journal
is
held
together
with
a
blue
wire
binding
accented
with
a
vintage
button!
There
seems
to
be
about
50
blank
white
pages
inside
this
journal.\r\n\r\nI
purchased
this
book
in
a
shop
in
Noe
Valley
(San
Francisco)
in
1995.
It
has
been
safely
tucked
away
for
the
last
12
years
and
remains
in
excellent
condition!\r\n\r\n*

Earthy
Funky
Lampwork
Necklace
Definitely
a
necklace
for
a
sweet
little
wood
nymph!\r\n\r\nThe
lampwork
pendant
is
made
with
2
deep
bronzy-brown
Swarovski
crystals
flanking
a
gorgeous
lampwork
bead
that
was
hand
blown
&
shaped
by
Kelley
of
Fireborn
Beads.
It&#39;s
a
slightly
flattened
barrel
bead
done
in
beautiful
earthy
swirls
of
greens
and
browns,
with
unexpected
-
but
oh,
so
pretty
-
sparkles
of
gold
&
bronze
throughout
the
whole
bead.
Hard
to
photograph,
but
the
sparkle
is
over
the
top,
just
right!\r\n\r\nI&#39;ve
covered
the
necklace
with
green
seed
beads,
funky
faceted
green
glass
beads
and
brown
wood
beads,
in
keeeping
with
the
foresty
theme.\r\n\r\nThis
necklace
measures
about
19&quot;
long
including
the
brassy
toggle,
plus
another
inch
or
so
for
the
pendant.\r\n\r\nPlease
convo
me
with
any
questions,
and
check
out
my
other
pretties
as
I&#39;m
happy
to
combine
shipping.
I’d
be
happy
to
try
and
take
a
few
better
pictures
if
you’d
like
to
see
more.\r\n\r\nHave
a
great
day
&
gimme
a
little
smile!\r\n

Mookite,
Coral

Jasper
Necklace
Mookite...my
first
experience
with
it...love
the
colors
and
striations
in
it...\r\n\r\nI
combined
these
five
pieces
of
Mookite
with
yellow-orange
coral
and
(mahoghany)jasper
(and
just
a
few
light
amber
crystal
seed
beads
for
spacing).
I
think
it
turned
out
very
well.
I&#39;ve
been
laying
in
the
sun
a
little
each
day
and
it
looks
really
nice
next
to
my
tan...would
look
lovely
with

or
brown
suit,
dress
or
top.\r\n\r\nApprox.

Clutch
Was
$22
Now
$10\r\n\r\nThe
Orange
Flower
Clutch
is
a
&quot;must-have&quot;
for
the
summer.
The
clutch
is
made
of
an
orange
flower
seersucker
that
used
to
be
one
of
my
skirts
with
a
yellow
lining.
It&#39;s
made
with
a
medium
interfacing
to
help
the
sturdiness
for
all
you
stuff
from
your
wallet
to
sunscreen.
The
Clutch
is
also
very
roomy
to
carry
all
you
need
for
a
night
on
the
town,
a
trip
to
the
beach
or
for
going
on
a
road-trip.
It
has
a
comfortable
handle
on
the
back
to
carry
it.
The
clutch
also
has
a
covered
button
closure.\r\nMeasurements-

are
three
(3)
large,
silver
metallic,
recycled
buttons
on
hand
printed
card
from
my
collection
of
vintage
and
recycled
buttons.\r\n\r\nThese
buttons
have
been
stitched
onto
a
hand-printed,
home-made
button
card
by
me.\r\n\r\nThese
buttons
are
not
new.
Some
of
my
buttons
show
minor
faults
or
show
some
wear
but
all
have
vintage
and
recycled
appeal
and
could
be
an
excellent
addition
to
your
next
sewing
or
craft
project.
Some
of
my
buttons
up
for
sale
might
be
just
what
you
are
looking
for
to
add
to
your
latest
scrap-booking
project
or
to
add
the
finishing
touches
to
your
new
hand-made
clothing
item.\r\n\r\nYou
could
even
use
it
as
a
gift
card
for
a
friend&#39;s
birthday,
mother&#39;s
day,
kitchen
teas.\r\n\r\nThese
buttons
are
sold
&quot;as-is&quot;
so
please
take
a
look
at
the
photographs.
Some
of
these
buttons
may
show
some
light
wear
and
aging
but
overall
they
are
good
second
hand
buttons
2.2
cm
in
diameter.\r\n\r\nPlease

How
I
created
this
illustration:
\r\n\r\nFirst,
I
made
a
digital
photograph
of
one
of
my
original
and
one-of-a-kind
24&quot;
standing
costumed
cloth
dolls.
I
then
exerted
further
artistic
digitized
process
upon
the
image
until
I
arrived
at
this
mysterious
figure...
anthropomorphic
bird
queen...evocative
of
the
surreal,
the
fantastic.
Exotic
costume...extravagant
headgear.\r\n\r\nThis
is
not
a
one-of-a-kind
print.
I
print
each
one
individually
upon
order.
I
sign
and
date
each
print
in
bottom
righthand
corner
with
gold
ink.
\r\n\r\nSuitable
for
framing.
An
archival
inkjet
print
on
Ultra
Premium
Photo
Luster
Paper.
Image
size
is
approximately
11
by

Paper
size
is
13&quot;x19&quot;.\r\n\r\nI
ship
each
print
flat
in
an
archival
clear
sleeve
and
securely
packaged.\r\n\r\nCopyright

Shamanic
Distance
Ceremony
Many
people
have
asked
me
for
assistance
with
various
conditions
and
circumstances
impacting
their
lives.
More
often
than
not
the
intensity
of
the
energy
of
those
conditions
and
circumstances
require
a
level
of
energy
not
available
among
the
current
options
in
my
etsy
shop.
\r\n\r\nSince
I
began
my
walk
on
the
Path
of
the
Shaman
an
important
component
of
my
work
has
been
distance
ceremonies.
I
have
hesitated
to
include
distance
ceremony
in
my
etsy
shop;
I
thought
it
too
commercial,
and
inappropriate.
However,
I
have
changed
my
mind
on
this
due
to
contact
with
clients
through
my
etsy
shop,
and
after
consultation
with
the
Spirits
of
the
Yachaqs
(Shamans)
of
Imbabura.
\r\n\r\nDistance
Space
Cleansing
Ceremony\r\n\r\nThe
Space
Cleansing
Ceremony
is
essentially
a
Shamanic
Cleansing
Ceremony
for
an
environment,
such
as
a
house,
office,
apartment
or
landscape.
Space
Cleansing
entails
the
identification
of
Spirit
entities
within
an
environment,
and
the
subsequent
removal
of
energies
having
an
adverse
effect
on
the
environment
and
the
people
within
it.
Unwanted
energies
might
be
one
or
more
of
the
following:
an
autonomous,
yet
parasitic,
Spirit
entity;
a
disembodied
Spirit;
or
the
energetic
residue
from
powerful,
traumatic
experiences
of
the
present-day
inhabitants.
The
adverse
effects
of
the
unwanted
energies
may
include,
but
are
not
limited
to:
recurring
health
problems,
feelings
of
intense
unease,
relationship
difficulties,
or
an
overall
sense
of
debilitation
and
loss
of
vitality.\r\n\r\nIn
the
Space
Cleansing
Ceremony
I
call
on
the
Spirits
of
the
Sacred
Mountains,
the
7
Sacred
Spirits
and
Pachamama
for
guidance.
Working
through
me,
these
Ancient
Healing
Spirits
release
all
energetic
entities
producing
negative
influences
on
the
current
residents
of
the
space.\r\n\r\nI
look
forward
to
working
with
you.\r\n\r\nTom
Arcuti\r\nYachaq

Purple
Crochet
Granny
Square
Purse
This
is
so
pretty!!!
I
don&#39;t
think
the
picture
does
it
justice.
Crocheted
in
a
yummy
Ty-Dy
Yarn
from
Italy,
it&#39;s
100%
cotton.
It
took
me
a
while
to
figure
out
how
to
make
these
bags.
I
saw
these
on
Norwegian
and
German
blog
sites.
Not
knowing
how
to
read
German,
I
studied
the
pictures.
With
my
love
of
Granny
Squares,
I
knew
I
had
to
make
one...and
so
here
it
is!
\r\n\r\nThe
bag
is
fully
lined
with
a
coordinating
fabric
and
has
a
pocket
to
hold
a
cell
phone
or
keys.
\r\n\r\nDon&#39;t
like
these
colors???
E-mail
me,
I
can
customize
the
colors
to
your
liking!

Greyhound
Wooliture
Needlefelt
Sculpture
Medium
I
love
to
make
greyhound
wool
sculptures,
&quot;woolitures&quot;!
I
would
love
to
make
a
very
unique
and
special
custom
greyhound
wooliture
for
you
of
your
beloved
grey.\r\n\r\nThe
picture
is
a
custom
wool
portrait
sculpture
I
sculpted
of
Timmy
a
retired
racer.
He
had
what
is
commonly
known
as
&quot;happy
tail&quot;
where
he
wagged
it
so
much
in
his
new
forever
home
that
he
kept
injuring
it
until
it
had
to
be
made
shorter.
This
wooliture
is
made
100%
of
wool
in
its
natural
colors
except
for
the
collar
I
made.
I
will
make
your
own
greyhound
in
any
pose
or
coloring
for
you
from
photos\\\\/descriptions
you
send
me.
\r\n\r\nThis
is
the
medium
size
and
they
range
from
4&quot;-6&quot;.
No
two
are
alike.
I
make
them
by
needle
felting.
They
are
soft,
warm,
light
and
unbreakable,
like
our
pets!\r\n\r\nEach
sculptural
artwork
is
completely
unique
and
personal
for
you.
These
can
not
be
reproduced
unless
I
go
through
the
entire
process
from
the
start
and
they
will
never
be
exactly
alike.
So,
your
wooliture
will
be
very
special
and
unique.\r\n\r\nEach
custom
wooliture
takes
me
from
3-6
weeks
to
create.
I
love
to
add
details
and
capture
personalities
in
this
artwork
that
should
bring
you
happiness
for
the
rest
of
your
life.\r\n\r\nDue
to
a
customer
who
received
their
custom
wooliture,
loved
it
and
then
did
not
pay
the
remainder
due
or
return
their
wooliture
or
respond
to
any
communication,
so
we
could
work
a
payment
arrangement
out,
I
will
no
longer
be
able
to
offer
a
50%
down
payment
up
front.
I
had
many
trustworthy
customers
who
paid
for
the
work
I
did
for
them.
Thank
you
to
all
of
you!
I
appreciate
the
majority
of
honest
people.
I’m
truly
sorry
that
I
have
to
change
my
policy
now.
\r\n\r\nPayment
in
full
is
expected
at
the
time
of
the
order.
When
you
receive
your
wooliture,
if
you
are
not
satisfied,
return
your
wooliture
in
good
condition
within
5-7
business
days
and
you
will
be
refunded
50%
of
the
price.
I
have
never
had
any
returned
for
repairs
in
all
the
years
I
have
been
making
these.
I
just
offer
that
as
an
assurance
with
this
newish
art
form.\r\n\r\nSecure
payment
can
be
made
at
www.paypal.com
to
email
address
RoseThistleRanch@aol.com.\r\n\r\nShipping
is
FREE.
\r\n\r\nI
also
offer
a
lifetime
warrantee.
Should
the
need
for
repairs
arise,
you
just
send
it
back
to
me
and
I
will
repair
it
for
free
for
life.
Although,
I&#39;ve
never
had
any
returned
for
repairs
in
all
the
years
I&#39;ve
been
making
these.
Since
I
densely
felt,
they
are
very
sturdy.
But,
I
offer
this
for
your
peace
of
mind
with
this
new
art
form.\r\n\r\nNeedlefelt
sculpting
was
only
discovered
in
the
1980&#39;s.
This
is
a
very
new
technique
and
the
cutting
edge
of
the
art
world.
I
just
love
to
create
personal
pet
portraits
for
people
using
this
technique!
It&#39;s
very
easy
to
learn
and
I
strongly
suggest
you
do
a
search
on
etsy
for
&quot;needlefelt
kits&quot;
if
you
have
an
inkling
to
try
it
out.\r\n\r\nI
will
also
make
any
other
breed
of
dog
or
any
other
animal
type
you
would
like.
I
have
three
different
sizes
of
custom
work
listed
as
the
top
three
items
in
the
shop.
\r\n\r\nThanks
for
stopping
by.
:D
Please
feel
free
to

Yer
Basic
Hot
Pink
Pouch
Baby
Sling,
Size
1
Most
all
of
my
&quot;Sized
To
You&quot;
sling
fabrics
can
be
made
into
lovey
blankets
or
a
diaper
&
wipe
clutch
to
match
your
sling,
just
ask!\r\n\r\nThis
fabric
is
97%
cotton
and
3%
spandex,
is
machine
washable
(cold
wash,
tumble
dry)
and
pre-shrunk.
There
is
one-way
stretch
to
this
fabric,
and
I
sew
the
sling
so
there&#39;s
some
stretch
vertically.
This
means
the
sling
is
less
likely
to
sag
with
the
weight
of
your
child,
but
he
or
she
will
have
a
little
wiggle
room.
The
pouch
seam
is
triple
reinforced;
many
people
carry
their
babies
from
birth
up
to
35
pounds
or
more.
Inspect
your
sling
regularly
to
ensure
good
condition;
I
choose
high-quality
fabrics
and
take
care
with
sewing
them,
but
please
be
responsible
when
using
a
sling.
\r\n\r\nThis
sling
is
a
size
1.
To
figure
out
which
size
to
buy,
please
take
a
soft
measuring
tape
or
long
scarf
and
loosely
measure
(not
too
loose,
not
too
tight)
the
distance
from
the
outer
part
of
your
shoulder
to
your
opposite
hip,
about
level
with
where
your
baby&#39;s
bum
sits
when
you&#39;re
holding
him
or
her
on
your
hip
(sans
sling!).
See
picture
above
for
how
to
measure.
Then,
find
your
size
on
the
following
chart:\r\n\r\nSize
0:
22.5-23
inches\r\nSize
1:
23.5-24
inches\r\nSize
2:
24.5-25
inches
\r\nSize
3:
25.5-26
inches
\r\nSize
4:
26.6-27
inches\r\nSize
5:
27.5-28
inches\r\nSize
6:
28.5-29
inches\r\n\r\nAs
a
reference
point,
a
size
3
sling
is
what
I
would
call
a
“medium”
–
i.e.
for
a
woman
of
average
height
and
average
bust
size.
Sling
sizing
is
an
inexact
science
at
best!
If
you
are
tall
or
busty
or
broad-shouldered,
you’ll
likely
be
on
the
higher
end
of
the
sizing
chart.
If
you
need
help
figuring
out
what
size
to
buy,
please
contact
me,
as
I
am
happy
to
help!
If
you
need
a
size
larger
than
6,
that’s
fine
too,
just
let
me
know.\r\n\r\nI
sew
these
slings
myself
while
my
boy
naps
or
plays
nearby;
I
am
proud
of
my
work,
I
am
a
strong
proponent
of
babywearing,
and
I
want
you
to
be
happy
with
your
purchase!
Please
contact
me
if
you
have
more
questions
regarding
my
slings.
We
have
a
smoke-free
home.\r\n\r\nI
accept
returns
of
slings
in
their
original
condition.
My
return
policy
is
to
work
with
you
to
make
it
right;
if
it
is
a
sizing
problem
and
I
have
more
of
the
fabric,
I
will
make
another
sling
for
you
or
refund
the
purchase
price.
\r\n\r\nThank
you
for
looking,
and
please
take
a
moment
to
check
out
my
other
slings,
or
contact
me
and
we&#39;ll
design
one
for
you,
together!\r\n

Chosing
a
Club
Vintage
Golf
Lady
Decorative
Painting
Note
or
Recipe
Holder
on
Wooden
Iron
by
Kathleen
Miller
&quot;Chosing
a
Club&quot;
is
a
traditionally
painted
notecard
or
recipe
holder
that&#39;s
even
more
charming
in
person!
It
was
created
by
my
friend,
Kathleen
Miller,
a
decorative
painter
from
North
Carolina.\r\n\r\nKathy
enjoys
the
challenge
of
turning
ordinary
wood
furniture
and
simple
accessories
into
impressive
works
of
art.\r\n\r\nA
painter
for
20
years,
she
has
completed
numerous
hours
of
class
instruction
and
has
had
the
fortune
to
study
with
several
nationally-known
artists.
Kathy
also
delights
in
using
elements
of
Early
American
painting
and
adapting
them
to
present
day
trends.
\r\n\r\nEach
of
Kathy&#39;s
creations
are
special,
and
no
two
paintings
are
ever
the
same.
Her
work
will
add
beauty,
charm,
and
warmth
to
any
home.
I
should
also
mention
that
photographs
can&#39;t
begin
to
capture
the
warmth
and
beauty
of
these
piecees.
You
really
need
to
see
them
for
yourself!\r\n\r\nThis
piece
will
be
securely
shipped
via
USPS
First
Class
Mail,
and
it
will
include
one
of
Kathy&#39;s
favorite
recipes
too!
Priority
Mail
and
International
Shipping
are
also
available.

YOUR

-
Artisan
rainbow
heart
furnace
slices,
crystal
sterling
silver,
heart
link
chain,
heart
toggles,
necklace
converts
to
a
bracelet
and
ankle
bracelet.
Was
$75.00\r\n\r\nAnd
now
for
something
completely
different.....Red
based,
heart
shaped
rainbow
furnace
slices
are
wire
wrapped
to
form
the
links
of
this
versatile
piece.
Loads
of
sparkle
and
flash
from
the
accent
crystals
and
seed
beads.
Finished
with
a
heart
shaped
toggle.
The
ankle
bracelet
is
created
from
heart
link
chain,
matching
furnace
bead
and
matching
heart
toggle.
When
the
toggles
of
the
2
pieces
are
joined
they
form
an
approx.
18&quot;
necklace.\r\nThe
bracelet
will
fit
up
to
a
7&quot;
wrist.\r\nThe
ankle
bracelet
will
fit
up
to
9.25&quot;
ankle\r\n(The
math
doesn&#39;t
seem
to
add
up
but
when
the
pieces
are
joined
rather
then
placed
around
something
like,
let&#39;s
say
a
wrist
you
actually
gain
some
length.
Who&#39;d
guess?)
In
the
photos
I&#39;ve
included
a
heart
slice
to
make
it
easier
to
see
the
shape
and
color
of
the
beads.\r\n\r\nAll
metal
is
solid
sterling
silver.
A
great
gift
idea
for
someone
special.
How
about
yourself?\r\n\r\n\r\n*A
little
info
on
the
focal
beads
featured
in
my
jewelry.
The
lampwork/boro
are
the
creations
of
some
of
USA’s
finest
glass
artists
and
the
furnace
beads
are
primarily
from
David
Christensen,
Carrie
Matthews,
Glass
Art
Works
and
Mingo
and
Asho.
US
furnace
beads
have
much
greater
detail
and
richness
of
color
then
the
usually
seen
imports.
All
the
lampwork
beads
have
been
properly
kiln
annealed.\r\n\r\n

SOFTEST
SUNRISE
EVE&#39;S
GARDEN:
ALWAYS
EXCLUSIVE;
ALWAYS
100%
SATISFACTION
GUARANTEED
OR
YOUR
INVESTMENT
CHEERFULLY
REFUNDED\r\n\r\nOh,
how
these
pics
failed
me!
These
beautiful
double-strand
beads
are
deceptively
sparkly...just
so
soft
and
serene,
but
with
a
glitter
that&#39;s
just
mesmerizing.
The
base
of
the
longer
(approximately
19&quot;)
strand
of
beads
is
in
the
purest,
most
elegant
powder
pink,
with
a
softly
swirling
ocean
blue
and
touches
of
dreamy
aqua.
Overlaying
this
elegant
color
combo
are
soft
little
accent
dots
of
the
gentlest
cashmere
tan.
Between
these
miniature
works
of
art
are
a
beautiful
array
of
Swarovski
pearls
and
crystals,
including
the
awesome
shade
of
Rose
Water
Opal,
a
luminescent
opaque
shell
pink
that
seems
to
just
glow
from
within.
The
shorter
strand
echoes
the
pattern
of
the
longer
one,
but
is
gentler
in
its
approach.
Some
of
the
smaller
donut
crystal
beads
are
opaque,
some
are
solid
in
color;
both
are
decorated
with
swirls
and
dots
of
the
cashmere
tan
found
in
the
larger
beads.
Between
each
smaller
lampwork
bead
is
a
lovely
8mm
Swarovski
Rose
Water
Opal
crystal,
cushioned
on
either
side
by
tiny
4mm
Swaroski
crystals
first
in
Powder
Pink,
then
Golden
Shadow,
then
Powder
Pink
again.
The
matching
French
wire
earrings
are
perfect
complements
to
the
necklace.
This
set
is
sublimely
comfortable
to
wear,
with
the
button
beads
laying
smoothly
on
the
skin.
Another
beautiful
EVE&#39;S
GARDEN
EXCLUSIVE.
\r\n\r\n
LAMPWORK:
Lampwork...
the
exquisite,
exacting
art
of
creating
glass
beads
by
hand,
one
at
a
time,
melting
colored
glass
rods
by
torch
and
applying
layer
after
layer
of
color,
mixing
and
swirling
the
patterns,
adding
precious
metals
like
gold
and
silver
leaf
and
sparkling
dichroic
treatments...each
finished
bead
a
unique,
one-of-a-kind
work
of
art.

Blue
Chevron
Chain

Peyote
Bracelet
Add
a
little
color
and
texture
to
your
wristwear
with
my
original
design.
I
created
this
bracelet
pattern
after
discovering
that
peyote
stitch
fits
perfectly
along
the
edge
of
a
strip
of
chevron
chain.
It
is
stitched
with
Nymo
beading
thread
and
made
to
order
so
please
allow
a
minimum
of
one
week
shipping
time.
If
I
have
several
orders
going
at
once,
it
may
take
longer,
but
I
will
let
you
know
as
close
as
possible
when
you
should
receive
it.\r\n\r\nPlease

Bright,

I
made
one

one
for
someone

This

The

it&#39;s
still

So
there&#39;s
definitely
room
for
growing

This

the
ancient
cultures
of
northern
New
Mexico.
A
wealth
of
petroglyphs
are
found
on
the

in
this
area
and
I
found
the
designs
to
be
beautiful
and
haunting.
This

represents
the
transfer
of
power\\\\/energy
between
shamans
as
well
as
other

important
to
the

of

Eibhear-
Celtic
Warrior
from
the
Other
Side
Traditional
celtic
folklore
refers
to
the
faeries
as
the
&quot;Good
People&quot;
so
as
not
to
offend
them.
The
good
people
are
powerful
tricksters
and
do
not
generally
appear
as
our
modern
perception
would
have
them-
frail,
cute,
winged
creatures;
they
are
not
to
be
taken
lightly.\r\n\r\nEibhear
is
an
elfin
warrior
of
the
mist.
He
is
a
protector
to
his
loyal
clansmembers,
but
care
should
be
taken
not
to
cross
him.\r\n\r\nEibhear
is
a
one-of-a-kind
needle-sculped
cloth
doll.
He
is
stuffed
with
polyfill
and
poly
beads
for
weight.
His
&quot;skin&quot;
has
been
painted
over
gesso
and
then
protected
with
acrylic
sealer.
His
hair
and
beard
are
made
of
wool,
each
&quot;dreaded&quot;
strand
meticulously
applied.
You
may
not
be
able
to
tell
due
to
the
lighting
in
the
pics,
but
Eibhear
has
a
purple
caste
to
his
skin
and
his
hair
is
a
plum
colored
wool.
His
myserious
eyes
are
kelly-green.
Eibhear
is
about
10
inches
tall
in
the
sitting
position.\r\n\r\nHis
plaid
&quot;tartan&quot;
shorts
are
made
just
for
him
and
can
be
removed
via
the
drawstring
in
the
back.
There
is
a
small
button
attached
to
the
front
of
his
shorts.\r\n\r\nEibhear
has
two
hand
beaded
necklaces-
one
is
made
of
wooden
beads
and
tiny
seashells,
the
other
is
made
of
seed
beads
and
has
a
tiny
crystal.
He
has
a
partridge
feather
in
his
hair.
He
also
wears
hoop
earrings
with
tiny
bells
on
them
(so
you
can
hear
him
if
he&#39;s
up
to
something
tricky).\r\n\r\nEibhear
holds
a
spear
with
a
&quot;flint&quot;
arrowhead.
&quot;The
arrowhead
is
actually
made
from
polymer
clay.&quot;
The
spear
is
removable
from
Eibhears
hands.\r\n\r\nEibhear&#39;s
hips
and
shoulders
are
jointed
with
buttons.
He
can
sit
in
many
different
poses.\r\n\r\nI
would
be
happy
to
answer
any
questions
about
this
doll
and
I
can
also
provide
additional
pictures
upon
request.\r\n\r\nShipping
is
free
for
U.S.
and
I
will
include
shipping
insurance
anywhere
(for
free).\r\n\r\nTHANKS

Ocean

set
Marked

from
$140.00\r\n
\r\nThis
set
is
one
of
my
favorite
creations.
Using
lamp
work
by
creationsbykris
I
was
able
to
create
a
stunning
ocean
piece.
These
beads
have
a
glitter
to
them
that
is
sure
to
catch
the
eye.
I
accented
these
amazing
beads
with
real
freshwater
pearls
and
swarovski
crystals.
Strung
along
seed
beads.
This
is
a
double
strand
necklace
that
is
joined
in
the
center
by
a
pendant
I
created
using
a
matching
focal
bead.
\r\n\r\nThis
flows
with
the
clasp
being
part
of
the
actual
design.
The
necklace
measures
about
20
inches
and
the
pendant
hangs
about
3
inches.
\r\n
The
earrings
are
3
dangles
clustered
together
with
lamp
work,
pearls
and
swarovski.

Painting
Pendant
Necklace
PLEASE
NOTE
that
this
is
a
real
work
of
art
done
in
the
USA
on
a
piece
of
jewelry!
It
is
a
pendant
(the
picture
just
does
not
show
the
hanging
metal
loop
and
attachment
on
top
--
you
wear
it
on
any
chain,
necklace
or
cord
you
may
have!).
It
is
a
one
of
a
kind.
The
painting
in
this
case
is
of
a
girl
in
a
white
summer
dress
standing
with
a
bouquet
of
colorful
flowers
in
her
arms
with
a
sort
of
floppy
gardening
hat
partially
covering
here
face.
It
is
about
two
inches
tall
and
much
narrower.
It
is
mounted
on
a
black
base
and
backgound
and
the
whole
thing
is
protected
and
beautified
in
a
clear
coat.
It
was
enhanced
with
a
slightly
antiqued
and
roughened
finish
overall,
the
edges
of
the
painting
as
well.\r\n\r\nPlease
note
Etsy
blows
up
the
photos
in
their
ads
and
crops
them
at
times
...
since
these
are
miniature
paintings
they
will
be
of
appropriate
size
and
clearer
and
sharper
in
person!\r\n\r\nThis
is
an
original,
miniature
acrylic
painting
done
by
me
with
quality
artist
paints
and
paper
(the
heavy
watercolor
variety
in
an
appropriate
&quot;tooth&quot;)
and
other
materials.
This
is
an
original,
One
Of
A
Kind,
NOT
a

I
also
retain
all
copyrights
to
this
work
and
it
may
not

DO
usually
ship
all

the
world
(please
read
below).
Note
that
I
am
soon
having
other,
online
payment
methods
(probably
even
by
the
time
you
read
this)
like
Google
Checkout,

but
checks
and

orders
are
just
fine
with
me
(foreign

please
email
me
first
because
there

for
you

which

Blingy
Birthday
Candles
Ok,
call
me
crazy,
finicky,
or
disenchanted,
but
I
think
that
birthdays
and
anniversaries
are
far
too
special
for
the
sad
variety
of
numeric
candles
on
the
market.
So
I
am
selling
my
own
rendition
of
them.
Well,
it&#39;s
the
same
candle,
just
kicked-up
a
few
notches
by
me
to
help
you
make
your
celebration
even
more
spectacular!\r\n\r\nIn
addition
to
my
doings
here
on
Etsy,
I
make
party
cakes
and
I
would
not
dream
of
serving
a
cake
with
no
frosting,
right?
Well
consider
these
&quot;frosted
candles&quot;.
Maybe
Plainfield
is
a
bit
far
for
you
to
travel
for
a
cake?
And
I
know
one
of
my
cakes
would
never
survive
a
trip
through
the
USPS,
so
think
of
these
candles
as
the
next
best
thing!\r\n

This
Is
a
one
of
a
kind
pendent
that
has
sassy
written
all
over
it.
The
size
is
smaller
than
most
of
my
work
which
gives
it
a
petite,
yet
noticeable
quality.
A
hard
one
for
me
to
give
up,
it
would
fit
any
lucky
wearers
desires.

HUG
ME
BIB
-
THIS
IS
SO
AWESOME
These
bibs
are
brand
new
and
homemade
by
myself.
They
are
made
out
of
quality
cotton
or
flannel
fabric.
Every
bib
is
lined
with
cotton,
flannel
or
quilted
fabric
with
top
stitching
around
the
entire
bib
so
it
keeps
it&#39;s
shape
washing
after
washing.
These
bibs
are
known
as
&quot;hug
me&quot;
bibs
as
they
hug
the
body
snuggly
and
protect
that
little
ones
clothing
from
food
and
spit
up.
This
bib
is
a
3
to
9
month
size.\r\n\r\nThe
bibs
fit
across
the
babies
tummy
and
have
velcro
in
the
back
and
at
the
neck.
The
velcro
in
the
back
is
approximately
2&quot;
long
so
you
have
a
4&quot;
variance
for
growth.
\r\n\r\nI
do
have
matching
burp
cloths
for
most
of
my
bibs
and
will
have
them
listed
also.\r\n\r\nI
accept
Paypal,
a
money
order
or
cashiers
check.
Payment
is
due
within
7
days
of
sale.
I
will
gladly
combine
shipping
on
any
of
my
items
for
$1.00
additional
postage
per
item.

Detroit
Still
Life
This
is
an
original
watercolor
painting,
15&quot;
X
22&quot;
hot
pressed
high
quality
watercolor
paper.
\r\n\r\nIn
this
painting
I
was
exploring
balancing
a
traditional
format
with
a
more
fanciful
one.
I
initially
painted
a
still
life
with
symbols
of
a
long
life,
of
learning,
and
of
death,
among
other
things.
I
then
drove
around
Detroit
and
took
pictures
of
cityscapes
where
I
found
similar
symbolic
references.
I
combined
the
images
that
I
felt
complimented
each
other,
and
then
I
incorporated
decorative
dot
patterns
where
I
created
fanciful
birds,
flowers,
and
water,
among
other
things,
to
convey
hope
and
rebirth.
\r\n\r\nThis
is
a
watercolor
painting
along
with
pen
and
ink
on
a
high-quality
hot
pressed
watercolor
paper.\r\n\r\n
It
should
be
noted
that
the
colors
in
this
picture
are
not
completely
true
to
the
original,
and
the
original
is
brighter
and
the
white
is
a
true
white--it
is
not
muted.
This
is
another
reason
why
I
started
doing
the
6&quot;
X
6&quot;
pieces:
I
can
scan
the
6&quot;
X
6&quot;
images
and
get
rid
of
any
shadows.\r\n

Included\r\n\r\nPlease
view
these
words
on

painting
plus
the,
&quot;The
Pledge
of
Allegiance
of
the
United
States
of
America&quot;
on
the
painting
in
the
lower-right-hand
corner
of
the
painting.\r\n\r\nIn
September
8,
1892,
on
the
200th
Anniversary
of\r\nColumbus
Day
for
our
then
44
states,
either
Francis
Belamy
or
James
Upham
wrote
these
words,
“I
pledge
allegiance
to
my
flag
and
to
the
Republic
for
which
it
stands:
one
Nation
indivisible,
with
Liberty
and
Justice
for
all.”
A
month
later
12
million
school
children
recited
the
words
across
the
nation.\r\n\r\nIt
has
been
changed
in
words
in
the
years
1923
and
1924.\r\nIn
1945
the
Pledge
to
the
flag
received
its
official
title.\r\nOn
June
14,
1954,
President
Dwight
D.
Eisenhower
added
the
words,
“Under
God”.
The
23
words
now
comprise
a
31
profession
of
loyalty
and
devotion
to
not
only
a
flag,
but
to
a
way
of
life…the
American
ideal.
My
painting
depicts
community
with…
&quot;The
Pledge
of
Allegiance&quot;
on
a
scroll.\r\n\r\nThis
is
also
of
jewelry
and
greeting
cards.\r\n
\r\nI
also
do
oil

by
commission
of

you
for
stopping
by
and
have
a
beautiful

Swarovski
Sparkle
Snowflake
Ornament
The
sparkle
on
this
ornament
is
awesome
and
when
surounded
by
lights
it
will
be
even
better.
It
has
a
high
sparkle
beacause
I
made
it
with
metalic
and
pearl
clays
and
inlaid
red
and
green
Swarovski
crystals.
I
further
embelished
it
with
a
glitter
snowflake,
icecicele
,
a
red
jingle
bell
and
a
red
wire
for
hanging.\r\n\r\nThe
ornament
measures
3
1\\\\/2
inches
and
is
reversable
so
it
looks
pretty
on
both
sides.
The
back
side
has
a
3-d
snowflake
pattern.

mod
cameo
necklace
I
had
the
idea
of
making
a
more
modern
version
of
beautiful
classic
cameos.
The
concept
overall
concept
was
black
and
white
images
with
one
focus
element
of
color.
So
after
trial
and
error
and
many
changes,
this
is
what
came
of
it!
I
specifically
like
this
one,
my
hair
even
looks
like
hers
now!
I
used
a
large
washer
to
give
it
a
sleek
modern
background
(I
love
to
use
unexpected
materials!),
hung
it
on
a
ribbon
with
a
bow,
to
bring
back
in
some
of
that
old
fashioned
beauty,
and
decorated
it
with
beads.
And
that
was
that!

This
goth
vamp
boy
looks
as
though
he
is
definitely
up
to
no
good!
You
can
just
see
the
hint
of
deviousness
in
his
clear
blue
eyes.
Perhaps
he
is
on
the
lookout
for
his
next
victim...will
it
be
you?
Will
you
give
in
to
him?
Will
the
blood
run
again?\r\n\r\nThe
original
was
created
using
watercolor,
gouache,
ink
and
iridescent
medium.
\r\n\r\nThis
print
is
printed
on

Enhanced

with
high

It
comes
packaged
in
a

Pink
and
Gold
Button
Bead
Bracelet
This
gorgeous
button
bracelet
has
been
handcrafted
and
features
glass
lampwork
beads
and
gold
vintage
reproduction
cutwork
buttons.
These
buttons
were
originally
produced
between
1890-1920
and
are
currently
being
offered
for
a
limited
time
by
the
LaMode
button
company.
The
gold
color
of
the
buttons
nicely
accents
the
pink
beads.
The
classic
design
makes
it
suitable
for
casual,
business
or
evening
wear.
Bracelet
measures
approx.
7.5
inches
and
features
a
gold
tone
toggle
clasp.
\r\n\r\nI&#39;ve
been
addicted
to
collecting
vintage
buttons
for
years!
Over
time
I&#39;ve
started
turning
some
of
them
into
jewelry
pieces.
Most
of
the
buttons
used
are
between
40-90
years
old
though
occasionally,
suce
as
with
this
piece,
I
will
use
a
contemporary
button.
Since
they
are
a
collectible
item
which
has
dramatically
increased
in
price
over
the
years,
all
of
my
button
bracelets
are
made
with
no
harm
to
the
buttons
themselves.
Thus
not
only
can
you
wear
and
enjoy
the
jewelry,
it
also
has
resale
value.
\r\n\r\nBracelet
will
come
with
care
instructions
and
be
boxed
ready
to
give
as
a
gift
or
keep
for
yourself.

So
soft

sweet
that
it
looks
as
if
it
would
melt

Still,

try
it
at
home.
Just
look
at
the
photo
and
sigh
heavily,
instead.

The

\r\n\r\nA
Note
on
Ring
Care:
I
do
not
recommend
working
in
the
garden
or
making
bread,
for
example,
with
one
of
these
on;
I
would
also
not
advise
working
construction
with
one
of
these
little
beauties
on.
They
are
made
of
metal,
it
does
bend.
If
it
bends,
it&#39;ll
bend
back,
however
metal
does
have
a
breaking
point.
Yes,
it
will
break
if
you
bend
it
too
much.
No,
there
really
is
no
telling
when
it
will
until
it
does.
If
your
ring
breaks
and
it&#39;s
the
absolutely
most
wonderful
ring
you&#39;ve
ever
had
and
you
can&#39;t
go
on
without
it,
email
or
call
me
before
you
send
it
back
to
me,
please!
Thank
you.

A

Infant
Insert
The
Turtle
Shell(TM)
is
designed
to
be
used
for
newborn
babies
through

months.
I
decided
to

because
I
had
so
many
requests
for
a
more
stabilizing
addition
for
those
very
delicate
brand
new
babies.
The
Turtle
Shell
makes
the
Hawley
Sack
the
first
and
last
carrier
you
will
ever
need
and
completely
versatile.
One
simple
addition
to
make
this
the
best
baby
wearing
experience
you
could
ask
for!\r\n\r\nThis
Turtle
Shell
is
a
super
soft
blue
fury
fleece,

The
Final
Elvis
-
8
1\\\\/2
x
11
print
of
original
oil
painting
This
is
the
last
in
a
trilogy
of
Elvis
Presley
paintings.
\r\n
\r\nI
actually
went
to
the
last
performance
Elvis
gave
in
Madison,
Wisconsin.
It
was
sad
to
see
him
look
so
terrible
on
stage.
I
pushed
my
way
through
the
crowd
of
screaming
fans
and
landed
three
feet
from
“The
King.”
It
was
strange.
Even
though
he
looked
bad
he
was
also
beautiful.
After
seeing
him
I
feared
he
might
not
be
with
us
much
longer.
So
I
went
home
and
painted
him
as
I
remembered
him
that
night.
He
died
three
months
later.
\r\n\r\nElvis
was
so
special
to
me.
I
still
have
this
original
painting
hanging
in
my
office.\r\n\r\nThanks
for
shopping
Art
By
Marilyn.
Have
a
beautiful
day.

Cozy
Knit
Gaiter
This
is
one
of
my
favorite
things
to
knit!\r\nLong
ago
I
had
to
spend
a
very
cold
winter
walking
across
the
river
every
day
to
work,
and
I
couldn&#39;t
feel
my
face
when
I
got
there!\r\nIn
sheer
self
defense
I
came
up
with
these
gaiters.
Sort
of
like
a
turtle
neck
with
no
turtle,
just
neck.
It
pulls
over
the
head
and
either
rests
on
the
shoulders
protecting
the
neck,
or
can
be
pulled
up
over
the
mouth
and
nose
on
REALLY
cold
days.\r\nAs
the
gaiter
doesn&#39;t
go
higher
than
you
want,
it&#39;s
perfect
for
wear
with
a
bike
or
motorcycle
helmet!\r\nKnitted
from
Paton&#39;s
Bohemian
Yarn
in
Poetic
Pinks,
this
is
a
perfect
item
for
those
allergic
to
wool...like
me.\r\nThe
yarn
is
a
blend
of
81%
polyester
and
19%
acrylic
and
is
a
super
soft
chenille.\r\nMy
gaiters
are
machine
washable
and
a
toss
in
the
dryer
makes
them
bounce
back
to
tight
after
long
wear
stretches
them
out!\r\nI
plan
on
posting
several
other
colors
soon.\r\nOur
home
is
non-smoking,
and
though
we
do
have
cats,
they
stay
away
from
mommy&#39;s
craft
stuff.\r\nWhen
you
first
get
your
gaiter,
it
will
be
quite
tight,
don&#39;t
worry,
that&#39;s
so
even
the
most
persistant
wind
can&#39;t
get
through.
It
will
soon
stretch
to
the
contours
of
your
face.\r\nI
have
4
of
my
own,
and
let
me
tell
you,
if
you&#39;re
and
outdoorsy
type
you&#39;ll
be
addicted
in
no
time!\r\nMine
make
hiking
in
the
winter
a
LOT
more
fun!

The

The

are

Older

may
have
some
yellowing,
creases,
tears

due
to
age.

Drawn
Mandala
This
is
an
original
pen
and
ink
drawing
colored
with
watercolor
pencils.
My
mandalas
are
organically
drawn
entirely
by
hand
with
no
computers
or
stencils
used.
\r\n\r\nWhen
I
draw
mandalas,
I
enter
a
meditative
state.
The
lines
and
colors
just
seem
to
flow
out
of
me.\r\nThe
word
mandala
comes
from
the
sanskrit
and
means
sacred
circle.
The
circle
symbolizes
the
womb
of
creation.
It
is
an
artistic
representation
of
the
cosmos,
a
focus
for
meditation.\r\n\r\nInfused
with
healing

Wood
Box
Purse
w\\\\/
Squares
Fun
and
fantastic
wood
box
purse
that
I
hand
painted
myself!
I
started
out
making
these
types
of
box
purses
before
sewing
ensnared
me!\r\n\r\nThe
pattern
is
a
whimsical
geometric
of
squares
and
circles
in
funky
fresh
colors!
Inside
the
box
is
lined
w\\\\/
faux
black
&
white
fur
to
protect
your
valuables.\r\n\r\nThis
treasure
can
be
used
as
a
purse
or
a
keepsake
box.
It
measures
approx.
7-1\\\\/2&quot;
long
x
5&quot;
x
4&quot;
high.
The
paint
is
protected
by
3
layers
of
sealer
and
rubber
feet
added
to
the
bottom
to
prevent
scratching.
New
hardware
has
been
added
also
to
jazz
it
up
bit.\r\n\r\nHope
you
likey
like!

\r\n\r\nJEWELRY
CARE\r\nTo
keep
your
jewelry
from
tarnishing
when
not
being
worn,
store
it
wrapped
in
a
soft
cloth
and
placed
in
a
zip
lock
plastic
bag.
What
causes
silver
to
tarnish
is
air,
and
when
it
is
not
in
use
the
more
you
can
keep
it
sealed
the
less
it
will
tarnish.\r\n

Holder
Vase
This
waffle-style
candle
holder
is
made
with
light
and
dark
blue
glass
together
with
white
and
clear
glass
to
produce
a

look.\r\n\r\nIt
was
made
by
fusing
strands
of
glass
together
but
it
is
completely
water-tight
and
could
be
used
as
a
small
flower
vase,
candle
holder,
or
simply
as
an
art
piece
or
mini
fruit
bowl!
This
eye-catching
piece
would
also
make
the
perfect
gift.\r\n\r\n--
**
--\r\n\r\nAll
my
glass
is
fused
and
slow
annealed
in
a
professional
digitally-controlled
kiln,
and
then
fire
polished
to
make
sure
all
the
edges
are
smooth.
All
glass
used
is
fuse
quality
and
COE
90

Origami
Ball
I
folded
this
colorful
origami
ball
with
24
pieces
of
3&quot;
paper.
It
measures
3-1/4&quot;
in
diameter.

fragile,
however,
it
is
glued
together,
so
it&#39;s
quite

Emotional
Turmoil
1
(Original
Drawing)
This
piece
is
an
original
drawing
from
a
couple
of
years
ago.
Measuring
5
x
7
inches
(13
x
18
cms)
it
comes
unframed
and
with
no
mount.\r\n\r\nDrawn
whilst
observing
a
life
model
I
love
the
looseness
of
the
line
and
the
image
of
the
turmoil
the
model
was
trying
to
convey.
Pencil
drawn
onto
white
paper
with
ink
and
oilbar
this
is
a
highly
textured
and
emotive
piece.\r\n\r\nOne
of
a
set
of
2
originals
(please
see
the
other
listing
for
emotional
turmoil
#2)
this
piece
does
come
unframed
however
I
have
chosen
to
show
how
it
could
be
framed
in
the
2nd
image.
This
is
a
wonderful
baroque
gold
frame
which
sets
of
the
tones
of
the
drawing
to
perfection.
Should
you
wish
to
buy
the
piece
in
this
frame
there
would
be
additional
cost
(as
well
as
additional
postage
costs).
Please
convo
me
for
details.\r\n\r\nUnframed
and

Natural
Aquamarine
Beads
I
LOVE
aquamarine!
These
beads
are
roughly
faceted
to
retain
the
natural
beauty
of
the
stone
itself.
The
color
on
these
range
from
a
light
green
to
a
light
blue,
with
spots
of
brown.
If
you
look
closely,
you
will
see
all
kinds
of
iridescence
going
on
inside
the
aquamarine.
SO
pretty.\r\n\r\nAs
you
can
see
from
the
photo,
bead
sizes
vary.
The
largest
measures
9x9x9
mm,
and
the
smallest
measures
8x7x5
mm.\r\n\r\nThere
are
10
beads
included.

\r\n\r\nThese

bound
with
an
exposed
spine
binding
method
called
the
Coptic
Stitch.
there
are
2
wonderful
features
of
Coptic
Stitch
bindings.
The
first
is
the
decorative
and
unusual
look
of
the
stitching
on
the
spine.
The
second
is
that
it
can
be
opened
fully
at
any
point
within
the
book
without
distorting
the
pages.
In
a
Case
Bound
book
(like
most
books
available),
the
pages
are
bent
because
of
the
inflexibility
of
the
spine.
Coptic
bound
books
always
open
flat
and
easy
to
work
in!\r\n\r\nThese
books
look
delicate,
but
are
very
durable.
They
stand
up
better
to
mixed
media
techniques
than
case
bound
books
in
my
own
artwork.
The
waxed
linen
thread
makes
for
a
very
strong
and
flexible
spine.
They
are
perfect
for
artists
who
will
be
using
a
multitude
of
materials
in
their
journaling.

tinted
hues
of
gray
create
a
stone
washed
effect
in

about
wonderful
shades
of

offering
an
easy-going,
relaxed
feel.
The
background
of
this
doo
rag
is
a
thick
stormy
slate
gray
color,
and
the
marbling
forms
a
lighter
smoky
shade
of
gray.

calm
and
mellow

scarf
is
suitable
for
anyone
from
biker
to
hiker,
male
or

or

it
in

the
bugs
from
buzzing
in
your
ears.

How
often
do
you
see
a
Bumble
Fairy
with
her
best
friend
flying
about
through
the
valley?!
I
take
it
not
very
often.
These
two
just
flew
by
me
one
day
and
I
grabbed
my
ink
pen
just
in
time
to
grab
the
whimsical
picture
before
me.
Sure
I
could
tell
you
more
stories...but
in
the
end
you
ought
to
let
your
imagination
run
wild
a
bot
too
and
make
one
up
as
you
go
along.
It&#39;s
all
in
good
fun
and
this
design
is
sure
to
bring
smiles
to
the
ones
you
send
the
cards
to.
Perfect
for
any
occaision
or
just
to
say
&quot;Hello&quot;.\r\n\r\nHandprinted
on
heavy
white
cardstock
paper,
this
pack
contains
6
cards
that
are
blank
inside
so
that
you

your

Casa
Rosada
multi-strand
bracelet
Andrew
Lloyd
Weber&#39;s
&#39;Evita&#39;
was
the
first
musical
I
had
ever
performed
in
at
the
tender
age
of
eleven.
When
I
got
to
see
Argentina
and
the
famous
Casa
Rosada
where
she
had
made
her
famous
speech
which
would
be
immortalized
in
the
moving
and
popular
aria
&quot;Don&#39;t
Cry
For
Me
Argentina&quot;,
it
felt
truly
surreal.
I
had
made
this
bracelet
as
my
interpretation
of
my
favourite
contemporary
of
a
woman
who
refused
to
be
defeated
and
had
beaten
the
odds
for
a
woman
in
her
era.\r\n\r\nBlack
glass,
hematite,
shimmering
rose
shell
and
black-stained
shell
with
Pollock-inspired
clear
beads
with
red
splatter
make
the
ensemble
of
this
tribute
piece.
The
bracelet
is
approximately
7
inches
in
length
with
a
hook
clasp.
Need
an
extender?
Message
me
and
it
can
be
done!\r\n\r\n***\r\nLook
out
for
matching
earrings!\r\n\r\n

Christmas
Cookies
Original
American
Oil
Painting
This
5
x
7
inch
small
format
oil
painting
was
painted
by
me
last
December
as
a
tribute
to
my
lovely
sister-in-law’s
wonderful
cookie
making
abilities.
She
had
not
been
able
to
visit
for
the
holidays,
so
she
sent
a
tin
of
cookies.
When
I
first
saw
her
Russian
Tea
Cakes
sitting
on
this
bright
red
envelope,
I
knew
they
had
to
be
painted.
The
holiday
season
is
approaching
again
and
it
is
time
for
someone
else
to
enjoy
this
little
painting
of
holiday
cheer.
The
painting
will
fit
easily
into
a
standard
frame
and
was
created
using
professional
grade
oil
paints
on
a
canvas
panel.
My
profile
contains
additional
information
about
the
materials
I
use
in
my
paintings,
shipping
information,
and
return
policies.
This
painting
is
sold
unframed.
Colors
may
vary
slightly
due
to
the
differences
in
calibration
of
monitor
screens.

Ohio
Flower
Bowl
Every
bowl
in
my
shop
is
made
through
the
traditional
(and
laborious)
method
of
raising.
I
use
hammers
to
make
flat
pieces
of
metal
become
dimensional,
and
then
I
stamp
them
with
a
quilt
inspired
pattern.
The
resulting
bowl
looks
like
a
combination
of
punched-tin
and
quilting.\r\n\r\nThe
flower
on
this
bowl
is
taken
from
an
old
American
quilt
that
called
the
flower
the
&quot;Ohio
Flower.&quot;
I
used
to
live
in
Ohio,
so
I
liked
that.

Fused
Glass
Pendant
This
is
a
beautiful
fused
glass
pendant
with
glittering
green
dichroic
lines
and
silver
dichroic
fused
into
pale
green
glass,
and
topped
clear
glass.
Green
vertical
accent
lines
complement
soft
colors.
The
pendant
sports
a
gold
colored
bail.
This
is
a
stunning
piece!\r\n\r\nSize:
1&quot;
wide,
1-1\\\\/4&quot;
high.\r\n\r\nI
have
earrings
that
match,
if
you
would
like
to
make
it
a
set.\r\n\r\nI
handcraft
all
of
my
fused
glass.
After
I
assemble
a
piece
from
layers
or
slices
of
various
kinds
of
glass,
I
fire
the
piece
at
approximately
1500-degrees
F.
Then,
a
piece
will
usually
be
further
cut,
ground
or
embellished,
and
fired
again,
sometimes
several
times.\r\n\r\nThanks
for
looking
at
my
creations!

Colorful
Paua
Shell

Etched
Wood
Dangle
Earring
As
a
long-time
Prince
fan,
I
couldn&#39;t
resist
using
these
engraved
tiger
ebony
wood
coins
from
Lillypilly.
The
symbol
on
them
is
similar
(yet
different)
to
what
Prince
used
when
he
became
the
&quot;artist
formerly
known
as
Prince.&quot;
\r\n\r\nI
added
a
colorful
square
paua
shell,
some
japanese
glass
seed
beads,
and
some
purple
swarovski
crystals
to
22
gauge
sterling
silver
earwires
via
simple
loops.
\r\n\r\nThese
earrings
hang
approximately
2&quot;
from
your
ear.
They
are
about
5/8&quot;
wide.
\r\n\r\nAll
items
will

Twine
and
PIne
Wooden
Doll
A
Country
Cutie!\r\n\r\nThis
Pine
and
Twine
doll
is
made
of
pine,
is
16
inches
tall
and
about
6
inches
across
the
shoulders.
This
is
my
own
original
pattern,
but
it
is
based
on
very
old
country
doll.\r\n\r\n
Her
legs
and
arms
are
jointed
with
twine
so
she
can
pose
nicely
for
you.
The
rough
edges
have
been
sanded
off,
but
no
wax
or
varnish
has
been
used
so
she
still
retains
the
rustic
look
of
an
old
handmade
doll.
\r\n\r\nHer
hair
is
also
twine,
embedded
into
her
head
and
glued
in
place.
She
wears
a
calico
cotton
pinafore
with
a
matching
bow
in
her
hair.
Her
hands
are
“spooned”.
\r\n\r\nShe
would
look
great
in
a
country
style
den
or
family
room
or
would
make
a
nice
friend
for
a
Raggedy
or
even
a
porcelain
doll.
I
made
her
to
be
displayed
not
as
a
toy,
but
even
though
she
is
not
very
cuddly,
my
six
year
old
niece
likes
hers
a
lot.
\r\n\r\n
The
arms
and
legs
can
be
untied
so
this
is
not
a
toy
for
a
very
young
child.

making

for

Felt
may
be
the

known

there
are
many
references

felt
in

Some
of
the
earliest
felt
remains
were
found
in
the
frozen
tombs
of
nomadic
horsemen
in
the
Siberian
Tlai
mountains
and
date
to
around
700
B.C.\r\n\r\nI
feel
it
is
important
to
support
these
ancient
and
traditional
crafts,
and
teach
them
to
our
children.\r\n\r\n

Nifty
Notes
or
Place
Cards
Series
no.1
Do
you
ever
want
just
a
little
note
?
You
know,
when
a
big
card
is
too
much.
Well
these
nifty
note
cards
are
just
the
thing
for
jotting
down
a
thank
you
to
a
teacher.
Or
leave
one
behind
after
being
a
house
guest
(as
a
thank
you
for
their
hospitality).
Do
you
have
a
coworker
who
needs
a
little
boost?
Or
a
husband
who
you
want
to
slip
a
little
note
to?
\r\n\r\nThese
folded,
mini
cards
measure
about
3&quot;
by
4&quot;
and
come
in
this
packet
of
8
cards
(no
envelopes
needed).
There
are
2
of
each
photo
and
they
coordinate
with
the
larger
card
series
no.
1.
(The
card
series
no.
1
has
been
sold
but
if
you
would
like
to
order
a
set
just
convo
me
and
I
can
get
them
right
out
to
you.)
So
you
can
buy
both
and
use
the
large
cards
for
the
invitation
and
use
this
set
as
the
place
cards
for
your
table
decoration.\r\n\r\nI
am
really
into
recycling
so
if
you
want
to
be
really
thrifty
you
can
take
the
used
place
cards
and
just
trim
off
the
bottom
portion
where
the
name
is.
Then
you
will
automatically
have
8
nifty
notes
to
use
for
whatever
you
desire.
How
is
that
for
recycling?\r\n\r\nAll
digital
photographs
are
printed
on
Fujicolor
Crystal
Archive
paper
and
are
checked
for
quality
prior
to
shipment.
The
photo
will
be
packaged
between
rigid
foamcore
sheets
to
ensure
its
safe
arrival
to
your
home.
It
will
then
be
mailed
to
you
thru
the
United
States
Postal
Service.\r\n

ARTIST
STATEMENT
+++\r\n&quot;Properties
of
Language&quot;\r\nThis
series
delves
into
the
mysteries
of
language
featuring
two
contrasting
subject
matters.
The
embedded
RAM
chips
symbolize
computer
language.
Communication
streams
have
rapidly
evolved
in
the
last
20
years
into
an
expeditious,
instantaneous
form
of
contact
through
the
cold,
impersonal,
abstract
means
of
technology.
The
white,
hand-written
language
goes
in
the
opposite
direction.
Its
forms
are
inspired
by
elegant,
handwritten
messages
on
postcards
from
the
early
20th
century.\r\n\r\nIt&#39;s
in
the
representation
of
rhythmical
delights
that
both
subject
matters
geminate.
Both
forms
feature
repetition
of
shapes
and
forms
found
in
the
exact,
rigid
quadforms
of
the
RAM
and
rhythmical
delights
of
the
elegant,
ascenders
and
descenders
of
the
handwriting.
\r\n\r\nThe
RAM
and
handwriting
contrast
and
compare
in
various
symbolic
and
formal
ways,
thus
demonstrating
the
powerful
range
and
capabilities
of
mankind
to
create
language.\r\n\r\n+++

Sterling

Wrapped
Lampwork
Glass
Earrings
I
love
the
glass
beads
featured
in
the
earrings.
I
purchased
the
beads
from
etsy
seller
yadanabeads.
I
used
sterling
silver
wire
to
complete
the
earrings.
To
accent
the
glass
beads
I
added
a
black
colored
glass
bicone
to
each
earring.
Earrings
dangle
from
kidney
shaped
sterling

earring
wires.
If
you

Round
Up
small
cowhide
zippered
case
No.
02
I
call
these
little
zippered
cases
&quot;Round
Up&quot;
because
of
the
natural
&quot;hair-on-hide&quot;
cowhide,
and
they
work
great
in
purses
or
brief
cases
to
&quot;corral&quot;
items
such
as
nail
file,
eye
drops,
gum,
loose
change,
or
business
cards!\r\n\r\nI
use
a
few
for
keeping
spare
batteries
and
adapter
cords
for
electronics
from
getting
lost
in
my
suitcase
when
I
travel!\r\n\r\nIt
is
approximately
4&quot;
high
and
6&quot;
wide.
The
nylon
zipper
has
a
5&quot;
opening.\r\n\r\nThis
model
#02
is
made
with
a
black
print
on
tan
cowhide
with
lavender
glazed
kidskin
trim.\r\n\r\nThe
hides
I
use
are
thick,
but
very,
very
soft
and
supple,
and
hair
is
silky
to
the
hand,
and
I
leave
it
unlined
since
the
underside
of
the
hide
is
also
very
soft.\r\n\r\n

Painting
a
Day
-
Cobalt
Blue
-
mini
oil
painting
I
wanted
to
become
a
better
painter
so
I
broke
out
the
oils
and
my
stash
of
canvas
panels.
Practice
makes
perfect
after
all.
This
is
the
fourth
of
my
painting-a-day
pieces.
They
are
all
5&quot;
x
7&quot;
to
keep
things
uniform.\r\n\r\nAfter
yellow
ochre
there&#39;s
really
nowhere
to
go
but
cobalt
blue,
my
other
favorite
paint
color.
I
know.
I
have
a
lot
of
them.\r\nThis
painting
features
my
favorite
blue
on
a
background
of
very
pale
blues,
yellows,
and
pinks.
It&#39;s
also
worth
noting
that
I&#39;ve
switched
to
white
alkyd
paint,
similar
to
oil
but
faster
drying.\r\nThis
original
painting
comes
unframed,
signed
and
dated
on
the
back.\r\n\r\nThank
you
for
stopping
by!

Pink
Checked
Cotton
Fabric
My
Cabbage
Patch
doll
dresses
are
made
from
the
original
patterns,
after
being
inspired
many
years
ago
by
a
visit
to
the
Cabbage
Patch
doll
factory...a
fascinating
place
to
visit...and
by
my
daughter&#39;s
interest
in
these
dolls.
The
older
dolls
are
collectibles,
but
are
still
being
manufactured
and
enjoy
a
change
of
clothing.\r\n\r\nListed
is
a
pink
checked
cotton
dress
with
lace
trim
across
the
bodice.
The
puffed
sleeves
are
a
contrasting
pink
to
match
the
darker
check.
There
is
a
back
opening
with
two
large
snaps
for
little
fingers
to
manage.
The
panties
are
a
soft
cotton
with
lace
trim
leg
openings
and
stretch
elastic.\r\n\r\nAlso
included
is
an
apron
to
keep
her
pretty
dress
clean.\r\n\r\nIf
more
than
one
item
is
purchased
from
my
listings,
I
will
adjust
the
postage.

Mosaic
Pendant
The
brilliant
shine
of
this
amazing
handcrafted
mosaic
is
virtually
impossible
to
photograph.
The
pictures
cant
even
begin
to
capture
the
blinding
high
polish
that
is
on
this
reversible
pendant.
Measuring
3\\\\/4&quot;
wide
by
1
1\\\\/8&quot;
tall
and
3\\\\/16&quot;
thick,
this
mosaic
pendant
was
painstakingly
assembled
one
piece
at
a
time
and
appears
to
be
floating
inside
the
timeless
designed
greek
key
sterling
silver
bezel.
The
many
textures,
colors
and
shapes
are
each
cut
by
hand
and
are
made
of
fine
silver,
sterling
silver,
copper
and
brass.
Mixed
metal
jewelry
is
all
the
rave
and
the
latest
in
fashion.
This
piece
was
time
consuming
and
labor
intensive
but
I
love
to
see
how
the
inlay
pieces
come
to
life
as
the
design
nears
completion.
This
unique,
one
of
a
kind
original
piece
will
bring
you
countless
compliments
from
all
who
see
it
as
well
as
many
years
of
joy
wearing
it.\r\nClean

We
take
a
new
INDOOR
set
of
Mini
Christmas
Lights
(20
clear
lights
per
string)
and
add
twenty
fired
12
Gauge
Red
and
White
shotgun
hulls,
which
we
have
modified
to
go
over
the
individual
lights.
\r\n\r\nWhen
the
light
string
is
opened
and
stretched
out,
the
hulls
on
the
string
are
attached
in
alternating
colors
of
red
and
then
white.
As
our
supplies
of
hulls
vary,
the
hulls
used
in
each
light
set
may
not
look
exactly
as
illustrated.\r\n\r\nThe
light
set
is
straight-line
(plug
at
one
end
only).\r\n\r\nOverall
length
is
approx
8&#39;
(the
overall
length
may
not
be
exact
to
light
set
you
receive
as
the
length
of
light
sets
vary
between
each
manufacturer
and\\\\/or
shipment).\r\n\r\nLight
Set
comes
with
two
spare
bulbs
(one
being
a
blinky\\\\/flasher
bulb).\r\n\r\nLight
Sets
can
be
used
throughout
the
year,
for
bar
decorations
or
unique
lighting
effects
in
hunting,
trophy
or
reloading
rooms.
The
pictures
don&#39;t
do
these
justice,
they
look
really
sharp!\r\n\r\nOur
Bar
&
Party
light
sets
are
carefully
put
together.
We
hand
pick
each
hull,
using
only
the
cleanest
hulls,
no
rusted
ends
here,
and
all
the
hulls
match.\r\n\r\nIndividual
lights
are
inserted
into
each
hull
by
hand
and
carefully
crimped
closed,
not
held
together
with
plastic
cinch
ties,
glue
or
just
flattened.
This
makes
for
a
nice
clean
overall
look.\r\n\r\nAdditional

additional

I

off
the

Ruby
Heart
Red
Tatted
Earrings
with
Swarovski
Crystal
These
are
new
vintage-style
blood
red
tatted
heart
earrings.
They
are
embellished
with
red
Swarovski
crystals
and
glass
seed
beads.
These
are
easy
to
dress
up
or
down.
They
are
very
feminine
and
dainty.\r\n\r\nThe
thread
is
very
fine
cotton.
\r\n\r\nThe
earrings
measure
2
1\\\\/4
inches
from
the
top
of
the
ear
wire,
and
1
inch
across
at
the
widest
point.
\r\n\r\n\r\nYour
earrings
are
new
and
unworn.
The
ear
wires
are
sterling
silver.\r\n\r\nWhat
Are
Swarovski
Crystals?\r\n\r\nSwarovski
(swore-off-ski)
is
a
company
in
Austria
that\r\nproduces
some
of
the
world&#39;s
most
beautiful
beads.
Their\r\nspecial
process
creates
components
that
have
incredible
brilliance
and
are
in
high
demand.
They
cost
a
little
more,
but
the
results
are
worth
it.\r\n\r\nWhat
is
tatting?\r\n\r\nTatting
is
an
ancient
art
of
making
lace
using
a
series
of
knots.
This
was
done
by
the
women
in
villages
to
make
fishing
nets
and
then
developed
into
the
art
of
lace
making
as
the
knots
became
finer
and
designs
more
sophisticated.
This
lace
is
extremely
strong
and
will
not
unravel
like
knitting
or
crocheting.\r\n\r\nCare
instructions
are
included
with
each
lace
purchase.\r\n\r\nThis
would
be
easy
to
customize
in
any
color
you
could
wish.
Just

me!\r\n\r\nSoli

Big
Red
Glass
Mobile
Title:
Big
Red\r\nDimensions:
4
1\\\\/2
ft
wide
x
4
ft
long\r\n\r\nHandmade
mobile
for
the
home,
office
or
garden.
Glass
pieces
are
individually
crafted
and
I
make
the
steel
structure
out
of
galvanized
wire
so
it
will
not
rust
with
age.
I
engineer
the
structure
so
that
the
mobile
dances
and
the
glass
pieces
will
never
smack
(it
is
not
a
wind-chime).\r\n\r\nI
make
glass
mobiles
-
a
simple
display
of
hanging
glass.
Kenetic,
like
Calder&#39;s
work,
but
primarily
just
a\r\ngorgeous
display
of
glass
in
all
its
properties.\r\n\r\nThis
particular
mobile
highlights
the
colors
that
Alexander
Calder
loved
to
use
(in
fact
he
used
little
else!)
RED
and
BLACK.
One
side
is
all
red
circles,
beautiful
yummy
garnet
red
glass.
Then
there
are
3
smaller
black
circles
on
the
other
side
of
the
mobile.
I
really
like
how
it
turned
out,
both
powerful
and
lovely.

Pit
Bull
Pin
CINNAMON
Cinnamon
is
a
Old
Family
Red
Nose
American
Pit
Bull
Terrier
looking
for
a
home
and
to
pretty
up
any
outfit
(jacket,
dress,
purse,
etc.).
Cinnamon
is
a
soft
&
wooly
Conversation
starter
who,
as
with
a
TRUE
pit
bull,
tough
exterior
with
a
mushy
soft
inside,
is
EXTREMELY
people
friendly.\r\n\r\nThe
Old
Family
is
a
line
of
APBT
that
is
red
nosed,
gold
eyed
and
a
piece
of
history.
An
exclusive
line
that
claims
to
trace
their
lineage
from
a
few
red
nosed
dogs
imported
from
Ireland
and
now
registered
with
UKC
and\\\\/or
ADBA.
As
well
as
the
color
differences,
the
Old
Family
Reds
have
a
bit
longer
nose,
for
the
most
part
a
more
intense
personality
and
conformation
that
holds
up
well
over
time.
In
other
words,
I
found
that
they
might
not
be
the
first
dogs
to
champion
in
the
conformation
ring
but
they
would
champion
against
younger
dogs
when
most
of
their
original
competition
no
longer
had
the
figure
to
compete
conformation
or
work
wise.
They
stand
the
test
of
time
and
abuse
of
working
(obedience,
agility,
hunting
&
farm).\r\n\r\nThe
needle
felted
pin
measures
3&quot;
x
2
1\\\\/4&quot;
with
a
golden
eye
and
red
nose
like
her
name
sake.
Unlike
a
real
adult
dog,
her
new
owner
gets
the
choice
of
cropped
ears
(upright),
prick
(upright
with
tip
over)
or
rose
ears.
\r\n\r\nSoft,
wool
sculpture
portrait
of
your
beloved
animal
made
without
the
use
of
patterns
or
kits,
this
is
truly
a
One
of
a
Kind
pin
or
magnet
sculpture.
I&#39;ve
named
the
soft
wool
felt
sculptures,
&quot;Woolisons&quot;
or
&quot;-sons&quot;.
These
awesome
handmade
animal
heads
are
felted
very
densely
creating
high
end
quality
artwork
and
detailed
to
breed
specifics
by
an
artist
that
has
shown
in
the
breed
ring
and
volunteers
with
multiple
breeds
and
mixes
every
week.
\r\n\r\nFor
custom
order
portraits
of
your
favorite
pet
or
show
animal,
I
will
be
working
directly
off
of
photographs
that
you
supply,
pictures
must
clearly
show
markings
&
profile
of
the
animal.
The
description
of
the
animal’s
temperament
helps
clarify
the
vision
of
the
animal
not
seen
in
pictures
and
allows
the
animal’s
shape
and
personality
to
appear.
A
portion
of
the
fiber
for
sculpture
can
be
from
your
own
animal&#39;s
hair
to
make
this
a
very
special
keepsake
for
you.
Each
pin
will
measure
between
1&quot;
-
2.25&quot;
and
because
of
the
lightness
of
the
wool
it
will
be
amazingly
light.
Please
allow
2-3
weeks
for
completion
from
the
date
of
payment.\r\n\r\nNeedle
felting
is
the
process
of
agitating
washed
wool
roving
with
a
wickedly
sharp
barb
needle
and
sculpting
it
into
shape.
A
special
barbed
needle
to
felt
with
and
several
different
high
quality
fibers
-
Corridale,
Merino,
llama,
alpaca,
angora,
mohair
and
other
animal
fibers
to
achieve
the
correct
colors
of
each
dog
breed
as
much
as
possible.
Each
dog
is
made
without
the
use
of
patterns
or
kits.
The
sculpting
is
done
by
poking
the
wool
fibers
thousands
of
times
until
they
interlock
and
felt
together
and
the
artistry
of
the
animal’s
shape
and
personality
appear.
As
with
any
art
form,
sometimes
the
“woolison”
takes
on
a
life
of
its
own
and
leads
the
artist
to
its
final
beautiful
sculpture
that
can
not
be
exactly
copied
or
mass
produced,
even
by
the
artist.
And
believe
me,
I
have
tried
to
make
the
same
animal
twice
and
the
wool
wants
to
do
what
the
wool
wants
to
do,
even
with
me
poking
it
into
submission.
\r\n\r\nRemember
the
Needle
Felted
Dogs
are
for
the
adult
collector
and
not
toys.
The
edges
amd
back
of
the
animal
are
fully
felted
and
finished.
Your

metal
pin

with
tight

stitching
using
heavy
100%
Cotton
Hand
Quilter&#39;s
thread
or
a

magnet,
please
request
preference
at
time
of
order.
If
you
desire
to
mount
it
in

the
pin
is

rubber
stamp
I
am
listing
numerous
rubber
stamps
from
my
huge
stash
of
unloved
(sometimes
unused)
stamps.
I
am
selling
each
stamp
for
a
fraction
of
its
original
price,
plus
shipping
and
handling.
Please
note
that
any
pixelated
images
are
the
fault
of
my
scanner,
not
of
the
stamps.\r\n\r\nMost
of
my
stamps
are
from
the
90&#39;s,
and
that
means
that
they
are
discontinued.
Some
are
from
companies
that
are
no
longer
in
business.
That
means
that
these
stamps
are
not
the
ones
you
commonly
find
in
the
stores
these
days.
Your
chance
of
finding
something
&quot;different&quot;
in
my
stash
is
pretty
good.\r\n\r\nThis
stamp
measures
about
3\\\\/4&quot;
X
2.25&quot;,
and
was
made
by
Stampart
Jubilee.\r\n\r\nRegarding
domestic
shipping:
With
the
new
postal
rates,
it’s
very
hard
to
predict
shipping
costs,
because
it
depends
upon
the
weight
of
the
stamps
you
buy.
I
generally
ship
priority,
and
I
will
ship
up
to
1
lb
of
stamps
for
$6.
Your
shipping
cost
will
never
exceed
$9.15
per
box,
in
any
case,
because
I
will
use
flat
rate
boxes
to
ship
large
numbers.\r\n\r\n*IF*
you
prefer
shipping
other
than
priority,
please
let
me
know
BEFORE
you
pay,
and
I
will
calculate
your
exact
shipping
cost.
Be
certain
to
include
your
zip
code.\r\n\r\n*****Also,
please
contact
me
BEFORE
paying,
for
actual
shipping
costs
outside
the
US.
I
have
recently
found
that
international
shipping
costs
have
increased
a
LOT,
since
our
new
postal
rates
started
in
May.
First
class
is
the
cheapest
rate
offered
now,
and
4
lbs
is
the
limit
for
first
class.
Anything
over
that
weight
must
travel
Priority,
and
that
*STARTS*
at
$36.

Length

inches,
genuine
gemstone

sterling

red
agate.
Thai
Hilltribe
silver.\r\n\r\nIn
ancient
times,
agate
was
highly
valued
as
a
talisman
or
amulet.
It
was
said
to
quench
thirst
and
protect
from
fever.
Persian
magicians
used
agate
to
divert
storms.
Some
believe
agate
renders
the
wearer
invisible,
and
due
to
its
strength
and
durability,
it
is
used
for
making
ornaments
or
for
astrological
purposes.
Agate
is
a
cooling
stone
and
is
said
to
cure
insomnia,
protect
against
danger,
promote
strength
and
healing,
and
ensure
a
healthy
life.
\r\n\r\nThai
Hill
Tribes
Silver:
Made
using
centuries-old,
traditional
methods
in
distinctive
Hill
Tribes
styling.
Because
it
is
of
95-99%
purity,
(higher
purity
than
92.5%
sterling
silver)
it
has
a
whiter
color
and
will
not
tarnish
as
readily
as
sterling
silver.

garment
is
drawn
indivisualy
with
wax.
Then
the
design
is
painted
usine
Fiber
Reactive
Dye\\\\/Paint
to
give
those
bold
colors.\r\nNext
the
design
is
covered
with
wax
and
placed
in
a
dye
bath.\r\n\r\nAfter
the
garment
has
been
submerged
for
at
least
an
hour
it
is
time
to
rinse
and
boil
out
the
wax.
This
sometimes
shrinks
the
garment
which
is
why
I
recommened
going
a
size
up.\r\n\r\nI
use
Eco
Friendly
soap
when
washing
the
clothing.\r\nBatiking
has
many
steps
to
it
and
we
strive
to
make
each
one
as
conciously
as
we
can.
The
wax
is
local
Beeswax
from
our
Co-Op,Salt
supplied
by
Local
Bulk
store,
and
Urea
from
local
Feed
Store.
The
AA
shirts
are
American
Made,
we
carry
Organic
Tees
and
other
tees
which
we
can
pick
up
locally,
the
boxes
are
re-used,
and
we
re-use
some
of
the
wax
again
and
again.\r\nWe
hope
you
enjoy
our
Batiks!
\r\n\r\n***CAN
SPECIAL
ORDER
THIS
DESIGN
IN
ANY
SIZE
ON
WWW.TREETOWNBATIKS.COM***\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEach
garment
is
designed
in
my
home.
The
process
begins
with
100%
pre-shrunk
Cotton
fabric.\r\nThrough
the
process
of
&#39;Batik&#39;,
the
fabrics
are
transformed
into
unique
and
colorful
garments.\r\nImages
are
hand
drawn
in
melted
wax
on
the
pieces
of
fabric,
one
at
a
time.
As
the
wax
cools,
it
hardens
in
to
a
resist.
I
then
paint
inside
the
design.
After
I
cover
the
whole
design
with
wax.
In
the
dying
process
colors
are
unable
to
penetrate
the
resist
patterns,
however
the
cooled
wax
cracks
allowing
some
of
the
dye
to
seep
through.
This
creates
my
one
of
a
kind
designs.
All
of
the
dyes
are
Proactive
dyes.
Will
not
bleed
or
fade.\r\nAfter
I
dye
the
material,
I
boil
it
in
soap
and
water
to
remove
the
wax,
and
further
set
the
dye.
I
boil
each
garment
twice.
After
a
final
wash,
the
shirts
are
then
dried.\r\n\r\nYou

Cherry
Hall
Table
This
&quot;Z-table&quot;
is
crafted
entirely
from
solid
wood,
with
the
top
and
base
made
from
a
single
board.
Each
piece
shows
off
the
unique
grain
patterns
of
the
tree
from
which
it
came.
Some
have
knots
and
sapwood,
in
the
tradition
of
Nakashima,
and
help
to
show
the
tree
from
which
it
came.
The
legs
are
solid,
laminate-bent
maple.\r\n\r\nBecause
of
the
design,
this
piece
has
some
&quot;give&quot;
or
&quot;spring&quot;
to
it
-
it&#39;s
strong
and
stable,
but
bends
and
flexes
with
weight,
making
the
piece
an
organic
whole.
\r\n\r\nThis
table
is
48&quot;
long,
9&quot;
wide,
and
36&quot;
high.
It
is
available
as
pictured
in
American
Black
Cherry,
as
well
as
African
Padauk.

Pink
Barbarian
Earrings
Here
are
some
chunky
funky
earrings
for
that
girl
with
a
little
barbarian
in
her.
They
are
girly
with
an
edge!\r\n\r\nThese
earrings
are
barely
under
2&quot;
long
from
the
top
of
the
silver-tone
earwires
to
the
bottom
of
the
earrings.
Each
earring
has
two
black
pink
crackle
glass
beads
around
a
silvertone
plastic
bead.
There
are
tiny
silver
glass
beads
on
the
top
and
bottom.
Since
the
large
bead
is
plastic,
they
are
fairly
lightweight.
They
will
come
packaged
in
a
small
box
made
from
recycled
cards\\\\/paper.
\r\n\r\nPlease
let
me
know
if
you
have
any
questions.
Thank
you!

Polaroid
SX-70
Manipulation
-
7x7
fine
art
print
in
11x14
mat
This
is
a
Polaroid
SX-70
manipulation
created
using
Polaroid
time
zero
film.
As
the
image
was
developing,
I
used
a
sharp
tool
to
move
the
image
around
to
give
it
a
“painterly
effect.”
Polaroid
discontinued
time
zero
film
in
2005,
so
this
print
is
truly
a
unique
piece
of
art
and
a
rare
find.
\r\n\r\nThe
7x7
print
is
on
Epson
Ultra
Premium
Presentation
Paper
Matte
archival
paper.
The
Ultra
Chrome
Hi-Gloss
inks
used
have
a
permanence
rating
of
110
years
for
Epson
prints
framed
under
glass,
based
on
testing
conducted
by
Epson
and
Wilhelm
Imaging
Research.\r\n\r\nThe
print
is
matted
to
11x14
on
6-ply
white
archival
cotton
rag
mat,
titled,
signed,
and
protected
in
a
plastic
sleeve,
ready
for
framing.
\r\n\r\nOther
sizes
are
available
upon
request.\r\n

Dichroic
Glass
Pendant
211
Dichroic
Glass
Pendant
211\r\n\r\nThis
pendant
is
approximately
1
1\\\\/4
inch
wide
by
1
1\\\\/2
inches
long.
\r\n\r\nMaterials
-
\r\n-
Dichroic
Glass
90
coe\r\n-
Silver
Pendant
bevel\r\n\r\nNecklace
is
not
included
(for
picture
only)\r\n\r\nAll
my
items
are
made
by
hand
in
my
home
studio.
\r\n\r\nPlease
keep
in
mind
that
dichroic
glass
is
very
difficult
to
photograph
\r\nand
some
colors
change
with
the
light.
No
matter
how
hard
I
try,
my
\r\npictures
cannot
do
the
pieces
justice.
They
are
always
more
vibrant
and
\r\nhave
a
depth
to
them
that
cannot
be
shown
in
a
photo,
you
have
to
see
\r\nthem
with
your
own
eyes
and
watch
the
light
play
with
them.
\r\n\r\nSince
the
cabochons
are
very
shiny
due
to
the
clear
layer
on
top,
it
is
\r\nnot
always
possible
to
keep
a
light
or
window
from
reflecting
off
them.
\r\n\r\nEach
cabochon
I
produce
is
layered
and
fused
numerous
times
to
achieve
\r\nthe
desired
results,
then
covered
with
a
clear
layer
of
glass
for
added
\r\ndepth.
\r\n\r\nI
use
only
the
best
materials
and
compatible
glass.
All
cabs
are
fired
\r\nat
the
correct
temperatures
and
properly
annealed
to
ensure
strength
\r\nand
durability.
As
the
final
step
I
then
hand
grind
-
or
cut
and
grind
\r\neach
piece
to
its
final
shape
before
it
is
fire
polished.
\r\n\r\n\r\nThe
cab
has
been
attached
with
industrial
strength
adhesive.

lovely

is
made
with
sterling
silver
rings

16
gauge,
woven
in
a
Byzantine
with
Roses
weave.
Six
little
sterling
silver
apple
charms
hang
from
the
middle
of
each
segment.
A
lovely
little

Midnight
Blue
Pietersite
Wire
Wrapped
Pendant
Aaah,
the
colour
of
midnight,
and
perfect
for
after-dark
wear!
This
pendant
features
a
cabochon
of
blue
Chinese
Pietersite,
understated
and
classy.\r\n\r\nBlue
is
the
rarest
colour
in
Pietersite.
The
brecciated
appearance
has
been
formed
by
the
folding
and
fracturing
of
the
earth&#39;s
geologic
processes.
The
finished
product
creates
multiple
colours,
hues
and
a
superb
chatoyancy
(the
bright
and
subtly
changing
shimmer
of
color
that
moves
along
the
surface
of
a
gemstone
as
it
is
viewed
from
varying
angles).\r\n\r\nI&#39;ve
wrapped
this
pendant
in
a
classic
style
with
14K
gold-filled
wire.
The
pendant
measures
2.4
inches
(6cm)
from
the
top
of
the
bail,
and
is
.8
inches
(2cm)
at
its
widest
point.
The
bail
is
large
enough
to
accommodate
most
chains
and
chokers.\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------\r\nI
love
creating
one-of-a-kind
artisan
jewellery
in
one
of
the
most
ancient
forms
of
jewellery-making
–
WIRE-WRAPPING!
\r\nWire-wrapping
requires
no
soldering
or
chemicals,
only
a
few
tools
and
a
will
to
create!
This
means
that
jewellery
designed
with
wire-wrapping
can
only
be
created
by
hand,
and
is
absolutely
GUARANTEED
to
be
unique!
And
designs
–
well
that
is
only
limited
by
your
imagination
–
infinite
possibilities!
\r\nI
only
use
precious
metals
in
my
creations
–
pure
sterling
silver
or
14K
gold-filled.
And
as
the
stones
used
in
my
creations
are
often
quite
delicate,
I
hand-buff
and
polish
every
piece
to
ensure
that
it
comes
out
to
you
bright
and
shiny
and
new
–
guaranteed
to
catch
the
eye!\r\n\r\nSo
if
you
enjoy
having
people
compliment
you
on
your
unusual
jewellery,
and
if
you
quite
enjoy
the
smug
feeling
that
no-one
else
will
EVER
be
wearing
the
same
jewellery
piece
as
you
are
–
then
you’ve
come
to
the
right
place!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n

Bead
by
Sooz
How
cute
is
this
guy?
I
was
making
a
bunch
of
polar
bears
and
didn&#39;t
feel
it
was
fair
not
to
have
an
Intuit
friend
for
them
to
play
with.
He&#39;s
an
inch
and
a
quarter
high
and
one
inch
wide.
The
hole
is
drilled
horizontally.
\r\n\r\nI
used
artist
grade
polymer
clay
and
hand
sculpted
him
without
the
use
of
molds.
I
mean,
who
wants
a
moldy
eskimo?

YELLOW
AND
MINT
GREEN
BABY
QUILT
Please
be
aware
that
my
pictures
do
not
do
justice
to
the
colors
in
this
quilt.
My
pictures
look
like
the
quilt
is
blue,
but
they
really
are
a
soft
baby
mint
(or
some
say
Seafoam
green)
and
baby
yellow
color.
This
quilt
has
many
hours
of
hand
quilting.
The
9
patch
squares
have
a
matching
yellow
printed
design
of
tiny
pink,
blue,
and
green
bubbles.
Center
mofit
is
quilted
in
a
circular
feather
stitch
with
4
tiny
hearts
in
each
corner.
Outside
border
has
hearts
quilted
all
around.
Quilt
measures
39&quot;
x
39&quot;.
Backing
is
a
solid
soft
yellow.\r\n\r\nAll
my
quilts
are
signed
and
dated.
Who
knows
I
may
become
a
famous
quilter
sometime
in
the
future.
A
treasure
to
be
cherished
forever.
\r\n\r\nThis
quilt
can
be
washed
gently.
I
would
do
it
by
hand,
but
can
be
machine
washed
if
you
wish.\r\n\r\nIf
you
would
like
me
to
send
another
picture
I
would
be
happy
to
do
so,
but
my
camera
is
just
not
picking
up
the
\r\ntrue
colors.\r\n

Blazing
Sun
necklace
Not
many
people
know
this
about
me,
but
I
have
relatives
just
north
of
the
border
--
a
whole
tribe
of
them.
My
grandmother
was
the
middle
child
of
12,
and
the
only
one
to
wind
up
here
on
the
East
Coast.
And
I
have
to
admit,
I&#39;ve
been
hearing
about
them
all
my
life,
but
I
have
never
once
been
to
Texas.\r\n\r\nThis
necklace
will
probably
not
make
up
for
my
lack
of
visiting.
But
at
least
it
proves
that
I&#39;ve
been
thinking
of
them.
Right?\r\n\r\nNatural
red
coral
teardrops
alternate
with
chips
of
amber-hued
agate
on
hand-wrapped
teal
wire
chain.
The
chain
is
finer
and
more
delicate
than
most
of
my
other
chains,
so
wear
it
gently.
The
pendant
is
a
genuine
Mexican
20
centavo
piece
from
1955,
and
has
been
polished
and
lightly
glazed
to
preserve
its
luster.
Approximately
20&quot;
including
pendant.

hand
forged
Chinese
Writing
Stone
pendant
The
stone
in
this
handmade
pendant
is
called
Chinese
Writing
stone.
The
stone
is
natural
and
this
particular
one
exhibits
well
defined
markings.
\r\nI
have
bezel
set
it
in
fine
silver,
and
constructed
the
rest
of
the
pendant
in
sterling
silver.
The
sterling
silver
has
been
forged
with
hammer
marks
echoing
the
marks
in
the
stone,
and
lending
a
rustic
look.
I
have
added
a
small
white
pearl
for
a
softer
accent.
\r\nTwo
rings
on
the
back
of
the
pendant
oorm
the
generous(5mm
opening)
bail,
and
allow
it
to
be
worn
on
a
wide
variety
of
chains,
cords,
omegas,
strands...whatever
you
like.\r\n\r\nThe
total
length
of
the
pendant
is
1
5\\\\/8
inches
(41mm).\r\n\r\n
It
is
sold
without
a
chain,
but
a
black
rubber
cord
can
be
purchased
for
$5.00.
Just
tell
me
the
length.

Dark
Earth
Abstract
Large
Glass
Art
Sushi
Dish
by
Thompson
Dark
Earth:
12&quot;
square\r\n\r\nThis
is
a
beautifully
subtle,
yet
quite
dramatic
piece
constructed
with
truly
stunning
Bullseye
art
glass.
The
central
elements
are
made
from
streaky
earth
toned
triangles
set
with
dramatic
orange
and
green
streaky
triangles.
The
orange
and
green
also
has
embedded
mica
for
a
very
subtle
sparkle.\r\n\r\nThe
streakies
are
set
with
black
to
define
and
set
off
the
color
and
bordered
in
a
deep
wonderful
pumpkin.
The
outside
is
set
with
translucent
taupe
and
deep
brown
to
cast
a
lovely
light
and
again
bordered
in
black.
\r\n\r\nThe
result
is
an
organic
earthy\\\\/mineral
look
but
with
a
high
gloss
of
polished
stone
or
glass.\r\n
\r\nThis
is
a
large
impactful
dish,
and
makes
a
lovely
focal
point
on
a
table
or
shelf.\r\n\r\nThe
process
for
this
piece
includes
hand
cutting
and
fitting,
then
detailing
with
geometric
shapes,
kiln
firing
into
a
single
heavy
glass
square,
slowly
cooling
to
anneal
the
layers
of
glass,
then
re-firing
to
slump
to
a
large
sushi
dish
shape.\r\n\r\nEach
of
my
pieces
is
a
one-of-a-kind
original
work,
hand
crafted
with
love!\r\n\r\nWe

Brown
Victorian
Kissing
Ball
Cellphone
Charm
A
long
name
for
an
item
with
a
fairly
long
story
behind
it.
We&#39;ll
save
you
the
details
except
to
say
that
the
handmade
bead
at
the
center
of
the
charm
is
made
in
the
style
of
early
Victorian
Christmas
ornaments.
The
subtle
brown
diamond
pattern
with
the
pin-like
dots
around
it
is
like
the
fabric
and
pin
patterns
on
those
early
ornaments.
(Yes,
there&#39;s
another
kind
of
kissing
ball
which
contains
mistletoe
in
a
glass
ball,
but
this
isn&#39;t
that
kind.)
The
red
and
clear
crystals
above
and
below
heighten
the
ornament
effect.

Permafrost
Record
I
tried
to
think
of
a
pun
that
would
match
this
piece.
\r\n\r\nBut
it
didn&#39;t
work
D:
This
piece
has
nothing
to
do
with
snow
or
Siberia.
As
far
as
I
know.
\r\n\r\nPainted
Record,
12
inches
in
diameter.
Hole
in
center
has
been
sealed
over
with
stiff
adhesive
and
paper.
\r\n\r\nThe
music
is
old
Church
Hymns,
I
believe.
You
could
try
and
play
it
if
you
wanted
to.
I&#39;m
not
sure
why,
though.

Little
Brother
Doll
This
is
a
Dollhouse
sized
Waldorf
doll
with
poseable
limbs.
This
dolly
measures
approximately
10cm
(4&quot;)
from
top
of
head
to
toes
He
is
stuffed
with
clean,
softly
carded
wool.
His
jumper
is
handknitted
using
100%
wool
sock
yarn.\r\n\r\nThis
dolly
is
ready
to
have
fun
in
your
dollhouse.\r\nHe
is
super
soft
made
from
cotton
interlock
stuffed
with
finely
carded
wool.
He
has
a
pipe
cleaner
frame
so
is
unsuitable
for
under
3s.
His
clothes
and
underpants
can
be
removed
but
are
safer
left
on
so
they
don&#39;t
get
lost.
Gentle
surface
wash
with
care
for
the
doll
although
clothing
is
fine
in
a
washing
tablet
mesh
bag
in
the
wool
cycle
in
your
washer.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis
is
my
favourite
doll
style
ventured
so
far.
The
appealing
moveable
limbs
and
size
make
it
lovely
for
children’s
hands
and
imaginative
Dollhouse
play.\r\n\r\nThis
dolly
will
be
mailed
with
a
card;
packaged
in
a
bubble
mailer
and
sent
with
care.
Thank
you

Indian
pony
necklace
I
recently
discovered
Vintaj
brass.
It
is
exceptional
quality,
and
I
love
the
antiqued
look
it
adds
to
my
pieces.
If
you
are
familiar
with
my
Indian
pony
necklace,
I
have
revamped
it,
so
to
speak,
using
these
Vintaj
brass
components.
\r\n\r\nThe
pendant
is
hand
painted
in
acrylics
by
me
and
is
sealed
for
permanency.
The
wooden
disk
is
1
1\\\\/2
inches
(32mm).
I
love
the
look
that
charms
add
to
a
piece,
so
have
added
a
charm
I
made
to
the
piece
also.
The
glass
beads
are
a
see-through
light
blue
that
is
cohesive
with
the
color
of
the
painted
pendant.
The
chain
is
a
large
8mm
link
chain
that
is
textured.
It
attaches
with
a
large
hook
and
the
links
are
large
enough
that
the
necklace
is
adjustable
and
can
hook
in
any
link
you
prefer
for
a
more
personal
choice
of
length.
At
its
longest,
it
measures
17
inches.
\r\n\r\nMy
hand
painted
pendant
is
signed
by
me
and
dated
on
the
back.

photograph
&quot;Path
to
Chenonceau&quot;
depicts
a
path
leading
up
to
Chateau
Chenonceau
in
the
Loire
Valley
of
France.
It
was
so
peaceful
there.
I
loved
how
the

made
a
green
canopy
over
the
people
walking
below.\r\n\r\nThis

gift-giving
or
for
yourself!
The

is
signed
with

It
will
fit
nicely

Christmas
Earrings
Bead
Woven
Ivory
Green
and
Red
EBW11
These
Christmassy
earrings,
woven
by
hand
in
the
south
African
Zulu
tradition,
will
help
you
swing
your
way
through
all
the
events
of
the
season!
I
used
ivory
colored
beads
for
the
center,
lustrous
green
for
the
border,
and
a
larger
red
glass
bead
accent
standing
in
for
a
holly
berry.\r\n\r\nMy
earrings
make
a
great
gifts
-
I
use
only
surgical
steel
for
my
ear
wires,
so
you
don’t
have
to
worry
about
whether
the
recipient
has
sensitive
ears
or
not.
This
way,
everyone
can
wear
them!
For
these
earrings,
I
used
ear
wires
trimmed
with
coil
and
ball
accents
which
are
plated
with
silver.

Egyptian
jewelry,
this
19-inch
gorgeous
necklace

in
a
&quot;root
beer&quot;

Brazilian
Flower
Ring
-
Cashmere
This
Caricoa
ring
made
of
glass
beads
is
inspired
by
jewelry
sold
on
Rio
de
Janeiro&#39;s
beaches.
Cashmere
is
my
fancy
name
for
this
shade
of
lavendar
-
soft,
supple,
and
lovely.\r\n\r\nI
have
lots
of
purple
varitions
here
(including
the
design
in
the
last
two
photos,
which
is
not
cashmere).
Check
them
out!\r\n\r\nThe
band
is
a
double
row
of
the
small
beads
outlining
the
flower.\r\n\r\nSome
customers
have
seen
similar
flower
rings
in
European
street
markets
as
well
as
in
Rio.
One
thing
is
for
sure
-
you
won&#39;t
find
this
ring
in
stores
stateside.
Only
on
Etsy!\r\n\r\nSIZING\r\nIn
the
message
or
note
field
of
your
purchase,
please
indicate
the
band
size
you
want.
The
flower
is
the
same
size
on
all
rings.
The
band
is
a
little
flexible
and
will
stretch
just
a
bit
with
wear.
The
band
can
be
made
in
any
size,
if
you
have
a
special
request.\r\n\r\nSmall:
If
your
hand
is
so
delicate
that
you
fear
handshakes,
this
is
your
size.
Tends
to
fit
young
girls
and
women
with
the
tiniest
of
hands.
About
ring
size
5.
My
7-year-old
niece
could
wear
a
small.
\r\n\r\nMedium:
If
your
hand
fits
inside
a
pickle
jar,
I
bet
you
are
a
medium.
Tends
to
fit
women
with
hands
on
the
petite
side.
About
ring
size
6
and
7.
Half
my
adult
customers
wear
a
medium.\r\n\r\nLarge:
If
you
can
give
a
decent
high-five,
I&#39;d
say
you&#39;re
a
large.
Tends
to
fit
women
with
very
normal-size
hands;
ring
sizes
8
and
9.
Nearly
half
of
my
customers
wear
a
large.\r\n\r\nExtra-Large:
If
you
could
hurt
someone
giving
a
high-five,
you
might
be
an
extra-large.
Tends
to
fit
women
-
like
me
-
who
have
a
hard
time
finding
rings,
bracelets,
and
leather
gloves
to
fit.

Pink
Handknit
Scuffs
Set
(scarflette
and
cuffs)
with
Vintage
Button
This
scarflette
and
cuff
set
is
a
fun,
easy
and
stylish
way
to
keep
warm
this
winter!\r\n\r\nThese
“Scuffs”
are
warm
enough
for
outdoors
and
light
enough
to
wear
indoors
(once
you
peel
off
all
of
your
outerwear)!\r\n\r\nThis
set
is
hand-knit
with
a
plush,
soft-as-a-cloud
cotton
candy
pink
yarn.
One
vintage,
odd-shaped,
pearlescent
pink
button
is
used
for
closure
of
the
scarflette.\r\n\r\nScarflettes
are
one
size
fits
all
due
to
the
stretchiness
of
the
knit.
Laid
flat,
this
one
measures
about
15&quot;.
The
height
is
about
3
1\\\\/2&quot;.
Wrap
around
your
neck
to
your
desired
fit
and
any
loophole
becomes
a
buttonhole.\r\n\r\nThe
cuff
stretches
in
width
and
is
about
7
1\\\\/2&quot;
in
length.
Pull
over
your
hands
up
to
your
fingers.
Stick
your
thumbs
through
any
of
the
holes
to
anchor
the
cuff
and
you’ve
got
a
set
of
fingerless
gloves!
If
it’s
really
cold,
throw
on
a
pair
of
gloves
beneath
the
cuffs.\r\n\r\nYarn

Minette
the
Mermaid,
Wall
Hanger
Doll
no.
28
Minette
the
Mermaid
is
my
own
design.
She
measures
12
to
13
inches
tall.
She
is
my
idea
of
what
a
mermaid
should
look
like!
She
has
large,
round
fish
eyes
and
a
pouty
sucker
mouth.
Her
hand
painted
face
is
dusted
with
glitter
(scales)
and
her
ears
are
webbed
fins.
her
hands
are
also
webbed.
Ears,
hands
and
tail
fin
have
needle
stitched
details.
Needle
sculpting
defines
the
breast
area.
The
face
is
made
of
various
shades
of
cotton\\\\/cotton
blend
fabrics
and
the
body
is
fashioned
of
stretchy
glitter\\\\/glitz
fabrics
in
various
colors
and
textures.
She
holds
a
sea
shell
full
of
beads
and
yarn
&quot;sea
weeds&quot;.
Her
hair
is
various
types
and
colors
of
yarn.
Hair,
beads,
yarn
and
hands
are
hot
glued.
She
is
stuffed
with
polyfil
and
has
a
ring
on
her
back
to
hang
her
on
your
wall.
No
two
mermaids
will
be
alike,
but
each
will
be
as
photographed.\r\n\r\nThis
doll
is
meant
to
be
hung
on
the
wall
and
used
as
a
decorator
piece.
It
is
not
suitable
for
a
child&#39;s
playtoy!
Washing
is
not
really
recommended,
but,
if
necessary,
wash
gently
by
hand
in
cool
water
and
air
dry.
Please
note,
hot
glue
has
been
used
and
may
come
undone
in
hot
water.
Face
paint
may
fade
or
&quot;run&quot;
if
washed
in
hot
water
with
strong
detergents.\r\n\r\nMinette
comes
with
a
tag
numbered
and
signed
by
me.
The
tag
also
says
&quot;McIntyre&#39;s
Handmades
which
is
the
name
we
crafted
under.
Too
wasteful
to
change
all
the
tags.

Purple
lampwork
flower
pendant
by
Snooty
A
very
pretty
pendant,
if
I
do
say
so
myself!\r\n\r\nCreated
in
the
flame
using
American-made
Bullseye
glass,
this
beauty
measures
about
38mm
in
diameter
(that&#39;s
about
1
3\\\\/8&quot;),
and
is
constructed
so
that
it
is
correctly
weighted
...
it
won&#39;t
spin
around
on
you,
or
hang
face
down.\r\n\r\nThe
pendant
is
made
from
a
special
production
color,
so
once
this
is
gone,
it&#39;s
gone!
The
base
is
made
on
a
3\\\\/32&quot;
mandrel,
so
the
hole
will
accommodate
a
silk
ribbon,
leather
cord
or
silk
cord
with
ease.\r\n\r\nMy
lampwork
is
annealed
in
a
digitally
controlled
kiln,
and
cleaned
with
a
diamond
bit.

diagonal
weave
vase
or
votive
This
vase
\\\\/
votive
was
a
moment
of
temoprary
insanity
when
I
became
tired
of
a
straight
weave
for
my
vases.
Although
it
is
the
same
principal
as
a
straight
weave
the
diagonal
weave
is
more
difficult
to
actually
put
into
place.
This\r\npiece
has
four
flowers
running
up
one
side,
and
two
bands
of
geometric
swirls
running
along
the
top.
It
measures
\r\n4
1\\\\/2
inches
tall
and
5
1\\\\/2
inches
across.
The
mouth
of
the
vase
is
3
3\\\\/4
inches
across.
If
used
as
a
votive
the
light
will
shine
through
the
small
openings
of
the
weave.

Prints
ITEM
DESCRIPTION\r\n\r\nBased
on
old
black
and
white
photographs
found
in
a
local
antique
store,
each
capturing
a
moment
that
was
new
and
exciting
when
it
happened;
fleeting,
fragile,
and
possibly
long
forgotten
by
now.
These
are
my
attempts
to
preserve
those
moments:\r\n\r\nIn
the
first,
a
boy
stands
with
his
father,
proud
of
the
new
work
truck
while
Pa
nonchalantly
holds
a
cigarette.
In
the
other,
three
generations
standing
together,
one
of
them
slowly
learning
to
stand
on
her
own,
but
still
with
a
little
help
from
her
mother.

Queen
Pocket
Mirror
A
pocket
mirror
labeled
&quot;Shopping
Queen&quot;
with
a
crown
on
a
pale
pink
argyle
background.
This
2-1\\\\/4&quot;
pocket
mirror
is
great
for
the
sassy
girl
on
the
go.
Small
enough
to
fit
in
your
pocket,
but
large
enough
to
check
your
sweet
self
out.
The
mirror
is
a
genuine
glass
mirror,
NOT
a
flimsy
foil
insert.
It
also
has
a
beautiful
piece
of
art
attached
so
everyone
else
can
enjoy
it
too.
Each
piece
of
art
has
a
sheet
of
mylar
on
top
on
it
for
protection.

What
causes
silver
to
tarnish
is
air,

the
more
you

the
less
it

tarnish.\r\n

beloved
fertility
goddess
of
the
Mayan
people.
In
the
Mayan
lore,
she
controlled
the
floods
and
people
would
pray
to
her
to
turn
adversity
around,
specially
during
those
times
when
childbirth
was
difficult.\r\n\r\nShe
was
hopeless
in
love
with
Kinich
Ahau
the
sun
god,
who
paid
no
attention
to
her,
until
Ix-Chel
found
a
way
to
weave
a
strong
cloth
with
her
moon
rays
to
capture
him,
and
they
became
lovers.
She
bore
him
four
sons,
who
could
shapeshift
into
mighty
jaguars,
powerful
enough
to
hold
each
corner
of
the
sky.\r\n\r\n(All
my
dolls
are
charged
with
Reiki
energy,
Universal
Love
and
light
force)\r\n\r\nPlease,
remember
to
handle
this
little
art
doll
with
care,
she
is
not
a
toy.\r\n\r\nApprox.
9
inches\r\nShe
makes
a
wonderful
Feng
Shui
companion
or
a
kitchen
witch\r\n\r\nSHIPPING

Confetti
hand
dyed
handspun
scarflette
I
love
this
one.
It&#39;s
got
just
about
every
colour
known
to
man
in
it.
I
threw
every
last
scrap
of
fiber
I
had
laying
around
into
a
drum
carder
and
spun
the
batts
into
a
bright
and
cheery
rainbow
yarn.
I
then
knit
it
up,
added
some
mocha
coloured
buttons,
and
voila!
A
scarflette
was
born.
It&#39;s
a
mix
of
fibers
from
BFL,
merieno,
shetland,
califonia
red,
etc.
It&#39;s
extra
cozy.
Sure
to
keep
you
warm,
even
on
the
chilliest
days.

Party
Girl
Party
Girl
is
a
very
pretty,
handmade,
one
of
a
kind
bag
that
would
look
great
no
matter
what
the
occasion.
\r\n\r\nThis
burgundy
colored
bag
measures
11-1\\\\/2”
diameter
when
laying
flat
across
top,
when

bag
is
about
8”
across
and
about
10”
tall
and
about
12-1\\\\/2”
tall
from
top
of
bag
to
bottom
of
beads.
Straps
about
18”
in
length,
long
enough
to
fit
on
wrist
or
arm,
and
made
of
a
green
and
burgundy
twist.
Strap
twists
have
been
crimped
with
a
silver
color
crimp
and

Glamor
Diva
This
fused
glass
diva
is
framed
in
a
black
8&quot;x10&quot;
frame
with
an
opening
of
4&quot;x6&quot;.
I
have
added
sterling
silver
wire
for
the
arms
and
hands.
Her
wrists
are
embellished
with
swarovski
crystals
and
her
quaint
bag
is
also
fused
glass
with
a
dichroic
clasp.
The
words
&quot;Glamor
Diva&quot;
are
placed
on
the
matt
under
the
glass.
She
is
attached
to
a
white
matt
with
irridescent
glitter
throughout.
\r\n\r\nEach
piece
of
glass
is
handcut
by
me,
layered
and
then
fused
together
in
my
kiln
at
1450
-
1500
degrees.
All
of
my
pieces
are
fused
with
compatible
glass
and
annealed
(cooled
slowly)
for
durablilty
and
strength.
I
also
incorporate
dichroic
glass
throughout
my
pieces.
This
glass
leaves
a
beautiful
effect
as
the
metallic
coating
absorbs
and
reflects
different
colors
of
light
at
different
angles.\r\n\r\nThanks
for
checking
out
my
things
and
hopefully
you
will
find
something
that
you
absolutely
LOVE
and
cannot
live
without!
\r\n\r\nFor
shipping
outside
of
the
United
States,
please
contact
me
about
rates.
Also,
feel
free
to
contact
me
about
this
piece
if
you
have
any
questions.

Connecticut.
Sachet
is
filled

Gorgeous
hippy
chicks
with
flowing
hair
often
seen
with
musicians
and
artists
from
the
60&#39;s

70&#39;s
were
the
inspirations
behind
many
creative

that
will
go

just
about
any
outfit.

will
fit
most
and
is
made
to
be
a
head
hugging
fit.

measures
approximately
18cms
(7
inches)
from
the
base
to
the
top
and
approximately
56cms
(22
inches)
in
circumference.\r\n\r\nIf

colour
and\\\\/or
size

make

The

is
that
its

be
2.5&quot;

3.5&quot;,
either
portrait

There
is
no

fit

collector

Flaming
Marshmallow
Silk
Scarf
Wear
this
to
your
next
cook-out,
and
show
your
love
for
the
most
delicious
dessert
of
all
times!\r\n\r\nThe
100%
silk
scarf
was
created
using
the
serti
technique
of
drawing
in
resist
lines
and
then
adding
color.
The
flaming
marshmallows
are
drawn
free-hand
in
gutta,
and
then
painted.
The
flames
are
orange,
yellow
and
red.
The
background
is
painted
black.
The
scarf
was
cured
for
24
hours,
heat-set,
then
washed
and
ironed.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis
would
make
a
beautiful
gift
for
someone
special
or
even
yourself!
It
can
be
worn
around
the
neck,
as
a
headband,
or
as
a
belt.\r\n\r\n100%
silk,
8&quot;X52&quot;.
This
scarf
can
be
hand-washed
in
mild
detergent,
and
ironed
on
the
back
side.

Mystery
Bag
Of
Home
Decorator
Scraps
13
PLEASE
READ!!\r\nThis
listing
is
for
a
mystery
bag
of
home
decorator
fabrics.
I
list
these
at
less
then
my
other
ones
because
it
is
a
surprise
of
what
you
will
get
and
because
I
don’t
have
to
take
the
time
to
take
the
pictures.
\r\n
\r\nYOU
WILL
NOT
BE
GETTING
WHAT
YOU
SEE!
You
may
get
something
that
is
shown
but
maybe
not.
All
of
these
fabric
run
from
$5.99-$30
a
yard!\r\n\r\nMost
are
dry
clean
only
but
I
have
washed
other
home
dec.
dry
clean
fabrics
before
with
success.
These
have
not
been
washed!
This
is
nice
stuff!\r\n\r\nThis
lot
is
perfect
for
covering
buttons,
using
in
quilts,
for
appliques,
hair
bows,
making
coasters.
Paper
crafting
or
lots
of
other
crafts!\r\n\r\nTHIS
IS
WHAT
I
WILL
TELL
YOU!\r\nThis
mix
has
a
little
bit
of
everything.
No
one
color
dominates
this
pack.
You
will
get
an
idea
of
what
is
in
this
by
checking
out
my
other
scrap
packs.
I
would
say
most
of
these
are
bright
fabrics.\r\n\r\nIncludes
13
pieces
of
12
different
fabrics.
\r\n\r\nLargest
piece
is
10.5
inches
by
24
inches\r\nSmallest
is
3.5
inches
by
12
inches
\r\n\r\nThere
is
10
oz
of
fabric.
\r\n\r\nIf
you
buy
more
than
one
mystery
pack
you
may
get
duplicates
of
fabric.
\r\n\r\nWill
be
shipped
first
class
within
the
USA
or
first
class
mail
international
to
everywhere
else.\r\n\r\nAll
items
come
from
my
smoke

Jellyfish
Girl
Watercolor
Art
Print
This
piece
is
titled
&quot;Jellyfish&quot;,
for
obvious
reasons!
It
was
done
with
watercolors.
\r\n\r\nThis
print
is
printed
on
8.5x11
Professional
Epson
Luster
paper.
Luster
paper
is
awesome
cause
it
doesn&#39;t
glare
like
glossy,
and
it&#39;s
much
more
vibrant
than
matte!
The
print
has
a
white
border,
and
is
standard
size
for
easy
framing.

fun
to
make.

pastel
pink
bunny
is

a

cute
little
guy
is
secured
atop
a

new,
lovely,
smooth,

Wanda
the
magical,
whimsical
garden
mermaid
goddess
of
hidden
bubble
land,
a
wonderful
magic
bubble
wand,
perfect
unique
gift
WELCOME!!
I’d
like
to
introduce
you
to
Wanda.
She
is
a
beautiful,
funtastical,
bubble
making
mermaid
that
would
love
to
live
in
your
garden!.
This
garden
goddess
really
loves
making
bubbles!
I
must
tell
you
Wanda&#39;s
little
secret!
She
just
comes
apart
(some
would
say
she
loses
her
head!!)
when
there
are
bubbles
to
be
made.
Actually
that
is
exactly
what
Wanda
was
created
to
do.
Her
head
separates
from
her
body
(she
doesn’t
mind,
I
promise!)
and
it
becomes
a
bubble
wand.
Wanda
will
make
a
wonderful
friend
and
perfect
unique
gift
for
that
wild
and
whimsical
goddess
in
your
life.\r\nWanda
is
guaranteed
to
make
many
bubbles
and
even
more
smiles!\r\n\r\n~Making
bubbles
every
day
keeps
the
grouchies
away!~\r\n\r\nA
few
interesting
facts
about
Wanda:\r\nWanda
is
made
up
of
100%
copper
and
copper
wire.
\r\nHer
body
is
a
brushed
texture.
\r\nHer
tail,
which
actually
moves
from
side
to
side,
is
a
lustrous
gold
to
teal-blue.
\r\nWanda
is
(from
head
to
tailfin)
14
inches
tall.\r\nWanda’s
head
(the
bubble
wand)
is
8
½
inches
long
and
just
under
4
inches
wide.\r\nThe
wire
that
holds
Wanda
up
is
30
inches
long.\r\nAfter
pushing
the
wire
into
the
ground,
Wanda
will
be
about
2
½
feet
tall.\r\nWanda
comes
apart
and
totals
three
pieces:
Head,
body,
wire
(goes
into
the
ground
and
holds
her
up)\r\nBecause
Wanda
is
made
with
real
copper
she
will
not
rust.
However,
copper
will
tarnish
naturally.
If
you
would
like
Wanda
to
stay
nice
and
shiny
simply
give
her
a
bath
in
a
mixture
of
lemon
juice
and
salt
every
once
in
a
while.
Careful
with
her
tail,
she
does
not
like
to
get
the
lemon
juice
in
her
scales
:)\r\n\r\nThanks
for
looking!
Enjoy!\r\n\r\nPeace
and
many
smiles!\r\n\r\nPaula\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n

&quot;Two
Trees
in
Copper
Twilight&quot;
-
Limited
Edition
of
50\r\n\r\nBecause
each
print
is
hand
painted,
each
will
have
it&#39;s
own
unique
pattern
of
bark
with
varying
branches,
root
systems,
and
colors.
You
are
purchasing
the
exact
work
you

listed
here
-
not
a
variation.

Paper
\r\n\r\n&quot;Two
Trees
in
Copper
Twilight&quot;
was
created
by
digitally
altering
a
scanned
image
of
my
original
woodblock
carving,
&quot;Shawangunk&#39;s
Tree
of
Life&quot;.
Printed
on
watercolor
paper,
then
layered
with
illustration
marker
and
hand
painted
with
acrylic:
Burnt
Sienna,
Burnt
Umber,
and
Metallic
Copper
and
Gold.
Treated
with
a
protective
matte
spray
finish.
The
back
is
signed,
numbered
and
dated.
\r\n\r\nBecause
of
the
way
the
copper
iridescent
paint
reflects
light,
this
painting
appears
to
change
shape
and
color
from
every
angle.
\r\n\r\nShipped

Phalaenopsis
Visceri
This
is
an
unedited
macro
of
a
backlit
white
phalaenopsis
orchid
&#39;internal
organs&#39;
at
the
atlanta
botanical
gardens
\r\n\r\nWhile
the
phalaenopsis
is
not
the
most
intricate
orchid,
it
is
actually
probably
the
most
common
clone
plant
that
you
find
in
grocery
stores\\\\/average
nurseries
etc,
it
still
is
a
beautiful
bloom.\r\n\r\nWhen
I
went
to
the
orchid
house
this
past
weekend,
I
knew
that
I
wanted
to
capture
the
internal
beauty
and
symmetry
of
orchids.
Hence
the
name,
visceri,
referring
to
the
internal
organs.\r\n\r\nI
hope
you
enjoy
this
print
as
much
as
I
do.\r\n\r\nThis
8x10
image
is
printed
on
high-gloss
photo
paper
and
will
be
delivered
with
chipboard
backing,
in
a
sealed
cellophane
bag,
inside
a
photo
mailer.\r\n\r\n&quot;Isn&#39;t
it
funny
how
the
most
common
can
be
so
beautiful?&quot;

What
is
sea
glass?
~~~
Originating
as
waste
that
was
carelessly
dumped
into
the
ocean,
this
glass
is
tumbled
by
time
and
tide
into
magically
smooth
and
frosty
works
of
art.
Sea
glass
is
from
many
origins,
such
as
glass
factories,
shipwrecks
etc
and
can
be
hundreds
of
years
old.
Through
immersion
in
water,
the
glass
is
hydrated,
allowing
the
lime
and
soda
to
leach
out
and
deposit
on
the
surface.
This
is
the
&quot;frosting&quot;
of
genuine
sea
glass.
My
sea
glass
is
never
altered
and
is
collected
from
beautiful
beaches
worldwide.

or
I
can
surprise
you

random
pair.
You
can
pick
a
matching

two
different
colors--you

from
rainbow-funky

a
more
sophisticated
black
pair.

of
earrings
is
unique
and
made
to
order.
The
decorative
beads
may
vary--if
you
specify
that
you
want
a
matched
pair,
I
will
match
the
beads;
otherwise
they&#39;ll
all
be
different.
All
earrings
are
made
with
fish-hook
earrings
and
are
about
1
1\\\\/2
inches

The

of

Unconventional,
mysterious,
spiritual,
magical.\r\n\r\nThe
walls
of
the
habitats
in
the
lost
city
of
Peru
and
the
incredible
peaks
and
forest
surrounding
it
inspired
me
to
create
these

Hill

made

that
surround
the
central
Blue
Peruvian
Opal

at

Machupijchu
were
happily
reuniting
with
us
on
a
magical
evening,
telling
us
their
stories
of
the
past.\r\n\r\nI
had
so
much
fun
making
these
earrings!
They
have
a
good
weight
to
them,
and
the
dangles
float
around
like
crazy.
The
colors
sparkle
in

very
pretty

unique

Each

is
carefully

so
that

These

are
handmade
out
of
a

has
been
prewashed
in
hot

dried
on

heat
prior
to

In
addition,
they
were
created
in
a
smoke-free
environment.\r\n\r\nThese
mittens
are
red
brick
in
color
and
would
fit
a
women&#39;s

EXPLORE
from
the
Halo
Series
Collage
This
is
an
original
mixed
media
collage
on
stretched
canvas.
It
has
been
collaged
onto
the
canvas
along
with
ephemera
and
other
papers
in
the
background.
It
has
then
been
detailed
with
inks,
acrylic
paints
and
stampings
to
add
depth
and
texture
to
the
piece.
The
sides
have
been
painted
to
flow
with
the
front
of
the
canvas
and
to
cover
the
staples
on
the
sides.
No
need
for
framing.
The
collage
has
been
sealed
with
matte
varnish.
And
the
halo
has
been
embellished
with
flat
back
pearls.\r\n________________________________________________\r\nTitle

Photography
Print
Encased
in
Mat
Front
Greeting
Card.
Envelope
Included.
--The
Listing--\r\nThis
listing
is
for
one
greeting
card.
We&#39;ve
taken
a
4x6
fine
art
glossy
print
of
&quot;REDFLORA&quot;
and
made
it
into
unique
stationery.
The
card
itself
is
a
tri-fold
card
with
a
mat-like
front.
The
photograph
is
encased
in
the
front
two
layers
of
the
cardstock
with
sturdy
adhesive.
The
card
then
opens
as
any
regular
card
would.
Since
the
front
of
the
card
acts
as
a
photo
mat
itself
the
card
makes
the
photograph
frame-ready
for
a
professional,
clean
look
when
popped
into
a
5x7
frame.
It&#39;s
a
unique
card\\\\/gift
combo
that
will
end
up
in
a
frame
rather
than
a
shoebox
in
the
closet
:-)\r\n\r\nInside
is
blank.
Each
card
comes
with
a
small
info
sheet
that
can
be
enclosed
with
the
each
card
when
you
give\\\\/send
it
to
someone.
See
pictures
for
details.
\r\n\r\nThe
photograph
contained
in
this
unique
card
is
printed
out
on
Fuji
crystal
archive
paper.
\r\n\r\nThis
white
card
measures
5x7.
A
matching
envelope
is
included.\r\n\r\n--Its
Presentation--\r\nOur
cards
come
presented
in
a

Warmer
This
toasty
handknit
neckwarmer
is

it

a

longer!
\r\n\r\nTHis

brown.
It
is
great
for
those
of
with

with
it&#39;s
alpaca\\\\/acrylic
blend.
Alpaca
does
not
bother
allergies
or
sensitive
skin
like
wool,
acrylic
is
a
synthetic
fiber
that
is
oh
so
soft.
\r\n\r\nFYI:
My
home
is
kitty
and
doggy
friendly!
While
I
keep
my
items
from
my
pets,
these
might
not
be
for
you
if
you
have
allergies
to
either.

scarf,
handspun
shetland
and
angora
I
knitted
this
scarf
from
yarn
that
I
spun
on
a
drop
spindle
from
one
fat
strand
of
shetland
wool
plied
with
one
fine
strand
of
natural
light
gray
angora.
There
are
also
stripes
of
pure
angora
yarn.
On
picture
four,
you
can
see
the
halo
from
the
angora!\r\n\r\nI
bought
the
shetland
wool
raw
and
washed
and
dyed
it
myself.
\r\n\r\nThe
scarf
contains
every
shade
of
blue
and
green
that
you
can
imagine
-
beautiful
-
with
the
light
gray
angora
mixed
in.
It
reminds
me
of
the
ocean
on
a
stormy
day\r\n\r\nIt
is
thick
yarn
that
was
knit
loosely
so
it
is
soft
and
squishy.
The
fringe
is
an
extension
of
the
actual
rows
of
yarn
that
make
up
the
scarf,
not
tied
on
after,
and
the
ends
of
the
fringe
are
lightly
felted,
so
they
will
stay
as
they
are.\r\n\r\nThe
scarf
is
about
63
inches
(159cm)
long,
and
the
fringe
is
6
inches
(15cm).
It
is
about
4
inches
(10cm)
wide.
It
comfortably
wraps
twice
around
the
neck.\r\n\r\nFor
me,
the
scarf
is
soft
to
wear
and
not
scratchy,
but
it
is
probably
not
a
good
bet
for
the
wool
sensitive.

Rose
Milk
with
Silk
Natural
Complexion
Bar
for
Sensitive
and
Mature
Skin
Timeless,
luxurious,
and
sensual.
A
combination
of
Rose
Water,
Rose
Damacena
Essential
Oil
and
Rose
Geranium
takes
you
to
the
delicious
scents
of
a
summer
rose
garden.
Roses
are
used
for
their
anti-inflammatory,
rejuvenating
and
healing
properties.
Rose
Otto
has
been
found
to
be
cicatrisant,
or
works
as
a
cell-regenerative
for
skin,
healing
for
scars.
\r\n\r\nRose
Geranium
is
mildly
astringent
and
an
anti-inflammatory.
It
is
calming
and
relaxing
and
great
for
the
complexion.\r\n
\r\nGoatsmilk,
full
of
Alpha
Hydroxy
Acids
has
rejuvenating
effects
on
skin
cells.
\r\n\r\nCoconut
Milk
has
been
known
by
many
cultures
and
used
for
centuries
for
a
more
smooth,
supple,
healthy
and
radiant
skin.
We
add
a
whopping
double
portion
of
coconut
milk
that
soothes
and
smoothes
your
skin.\r\n\r\nThis
bar
also
contains
colloidal
oatmeal
(oatmeal
flour)
and
finely
ground
oats.
Oatmeal
has
a
long
history
of
use
in
helping
alleviate
skin
irritation
and
inflammation.
Oatmeal
is
very
soothing
to
the
skin.
Its
strong
anti-inflammatory
effects
and
colloidal\r\noatmeal
is
classified
by
the
FDA
as
a
&quot;skin
protectant.&quot;
Oatmeal
not
only
can
help
with
skin
sensitivity
but
may
also
have
a
preventive
effect
on
irritation
and
may
help
repair
damage
from
other
skin
stressors.\r\n\r\nWe
dissolve
silk
fibers
during
the
soap
making
process
and
the
silk
protein
imparts
a
wonderful
softening
quality
to
the
skin,
leaving
it
silky
smooth!
We
use
the
silk
as
an
alternative
to
lanolin,
which
can
cause
allergic
reactions.\r\nRose
Milk
with
Silk
is
a
luxurious
moisturizing
bar
to
nourish,
condition
and
protect
your
skin.\r\n\r\nGreat
for
all
skin
types,
especially
Sensitive
and
Mature
skin.\r\n\r\n

Giclee
Print
This
is
the
fourth
teacup
in
my
series
of
&quot;Teacups
and
Teapots&quot;.\r\nI
absolutely
love
tea
and
I
collect
funky
teapots,
so
I
was
inspired
to
create
some
fun
illustrations
of
them
:)\r\n\r\nThis
set
was
inspired
by
my
mom
:)\r\n\r\n&quot;Mom&#39;s
Cup
of
Tea&quot;
is
a
print
of
an
original
vector
illustration,
made
in
Adobe
Illustrator.\r\n\r\nIt
measures
8x10&quot;
and
is
printed
on
8.5&quot;x11&quot;
Epson
acid-free
Velvet
Fine
Art
paper,
using
Epson
UltraChrome
K3
archival
inks.
There
is
a
nice
white
boarder
around
the
image,
making
it
perfect
for
framing
:)\r\n\r\nIt
is
signed
and
dated
by
hand
on
the
front
and
is
packed
in
an
archival
sleeve.
The
print
will
be
mailed
in
a
very
sturdy
cardboard
envelope.
To
ensure
prompt
shipping,
please
pay
at
time
of
purchase,
as
I
will
only
ship
the
print
after
I
have
received
the
payment
:)\r\n\r\n\r\n**Please
note
that
the
colour
may
slightly
vary
depending
on
your
monitor,
and
that
the
copy
write
watermark
will
not
appear
on
your
print.**\r\n\r\n**The
colour
of
this
print
is
MUCH
more
vibrant
in
person
-
the
digital
file
when
uploading
to
Etsy
seems
to
have
darkened
it

beach.
I
can&#39;t
just
lie
there,
I
burn
easily,

there&#39;s
so
much

to
play
with.
I
built
a
little
road
of
flat
stones,
and
a
fence
of
twigs.
Exhausted
from
the
construction,
I
lay
back
with
my
camera
and
photographed
stuff.

Treasure
Bag
We
all
love
treasures
and
a
Treasure
Bag
is
a
wonderful
way
to
store
the
items
that
we
love
to
collect.
Kids
especially
like
to
collect
and
carry
their
trinkets.
Seashells,
marbles,
toy
cars,
small
doll
accessories,
and
rocks
are
just
a
few
of
many
items
that
are
fun
to
collect.
\r\n\r\nWith
sturdy
construction,
finished
seems
and
a
durable
cord
with
toggle
for
secure
closure,
this
treasure
bag
could
also
be
used
to
carry
small
cosmetics
or
even
a
small
wallet,
keys
and\\\\/or
cell
phone.
\r\n\r\nThe
fabric
is
pre-washed
and
the
Treasure
Bag
can
be
washed
right
in
the
machine
if
needed
without
the
worry
of
shrinkage.
It
is
recommended
that
you
air
dry
the
bag
after
washing
or
dry
on
low
heat
setting
to
protect
toggle.\r\n\r\nMeasures
approximately
7.5”

A
Little
Bit
of
Gypsy
Bracelet
NOW
ON
SALE!
An
amazing
look
for
just
$85.00
down
from
$110.00!\r\n\r\nThis
is
another
syle
of
hand
painted
glass
beads
that
features
a
sun
burst
type
design.
The
glass
bead
is
bright
red
with
black,
white,
and
gold
accent
colors.
So
I
used
little
slices
of
fauceted
citrine
to
accent,
they
are
wire
wrapped
to
sterling
silver
three
demensional
flowers,
and
then
the
balance
of
the
bracelet
is
made
up
of
sterling
silver
and
14k
gold
fill
beads.
This
bracelet
has
all
kinds
of
texture
and
movement,
which
makes
it
very
gypsy
and
fun!
The
clasp
is
a
large
hammered
sterling
silver
toggle
clasp
and
there
is
a
dangle
hanging
from
the
loop
of
the
toogle.
The
length
is
8
1/4&quot;
long,
and
just
keep
in
mind
before
you
think
that
is
too
long,
that
the
scale
of
this
bracelet
is
large,
therefore
you
need
alittle
addtional
length
from
your
average
bracelets
inorder
for
this
one
to
fit
comfortably!
However,
it
can
be
resized
the
first
time
for
free,
before
it
is
sent
out.
Just
let
me
know
and
I
will
be
happy
to
make
it
happen!

1997

1998,
on

of
the
millennium,
i
did
a
series
of
fabric
collages
having
to
do
with
the
year
1000.\r\npeople
believed
the
year
1000
was
the
end
of
time,
some
even
stopped
planting
crops
and
prepared
for
the
end.
the
tabloids
in
the
U.S.
treated
the
approaching
millennium
in
a
similar
fashion
with
sweeping
statements
about
the
apocalypse.\r\nthese
collages
use
cotton
fabric,
photo
transfers,
photos
of
my
travels,
and
images
of
Byzantine
art.
i
dyed
the
fabric
with
teas
and
used
the
color
gold
throughout
the
series.\r\nthe
photo
transfers
were
done
by

One

my

has
just
told
me
that
she
is
going
to
have
her
first
baby
and
it
is
going

be
a
little

I
wanted
to
give
her
something
really
special,
so
I
was
inspired
to
create
this
drawing.
There
is
something
amazing
about
the
connection
between
a
mother
and
a

It
was
printed
on

that
has
a

to
it.
It
is
signed
and
dated

the

An

on
your

with
no

or
shifting.\r\n\r\nThis

cushion
is
all
cut,
stuffed
and
sewn
by

Faux
Bois
Ring
1
My
new
line
of
woodgrain
rings
-
faux
bois
for
the
masses!\r\n\r\nIt&#39;s
not
even
forced
for
me
to
say
&quot;faux
bois&quot;,
since
I
live
in
a
french
speaking
community
;)\r\n\r\nMade
from
an
excellent
photographic
representation
of
real
wood
(from
my
secret
and
limited
source)
glued
into
a
decorative
brass
setting
and
encased
in
layers
of
hard
resin,
clear
as
glass!
\r\n\r\nThe
setting
has
been
securely
attached
to
an
adjustable
goldtone
ring
base
(using
industrial
strength
glue).\r\n\r\nThe
setting
measures
a
little
over
3\\\\/4&quot;
long
and
1\\\\/2&quot;
wide.\r\n\r\nStay
tuned
for
more!\r\n\r\n**Please
note,
I
apologize
for
the
high
shipping
fees...shipping
for
rings
costs
more
due
to
the
thickness
when
packaged...
but
rest
assured
they
will
arrive
safer
and
sounder
this
way
than
if
shipped
unsecurely!***

Meditation
Star
Quilt
This
quilt
was
made
as
a
meditation
mat.
It
is
made
in
earth
tones
and
has
a
very
obvious
central
point.
I
know
people
who
find
it
very
relaxing
to
have
a
place
that
is
just
theirs
to
sit
and
meditate
and
they
enjoy
the
use
of
these
mats.\r\n
This
quilt
is
39in
x
39in
and
could
be
used
in
a
number
of
ways.
It
could
be
used
as
the
above
mentioned
meditation
mat,
a
wallhanging,
table
cover,
couch
cover
or
anything
else
you
can
think
of.
It
is
machine
pieced
and
quilted.
:)\r\n\r\nMade
in
a
smoke
free
home.

Ladies
Vintage
Style
Ruffled
Apron
Based
on
a
1940&#39;s
style,
but
resized
for
today,
this
retro
apron
features
a
cotton
floral
reproduction
of
a
feedsack
print.
A
perfectly
coordinated
softly
toned
cotton
floral
was
used
for
the
ruffle
and
the
cotton
ties
(another
reproduction
feedsack
print)
finish
the
piece
off
nicely.
The
pocket
was
repurposed
from
a
gentleman&#39;s
shirt.
The
piece
is
standard
in
size
and
measures
32
1\\\\/2
inches
from
the
top
of
the
bib
to
the
bottom
of
the
ruffle
and
30
1\\\\/2
inches
across
the
widest
point
(excluding
ties).
Please
note
that
here
in
South
Florida,
the
sun
can
be
quite
bright.
The
pictures
do
not
do
this
piece
justice!
The
detailed
swatch
pictures
provide
a
more
accurate
representation
of
the
fabrics
true
colors.

Godiva
These
earrings
are
luscious,
like
a
bite
of
godiva
chocolate.
Unique,
elegant,
and
feminine,
you
could
wear
these
and
nothing
else
and
feel
like
Lady
Godiva
herself!\r\n\r\nThe
legend
of
Lady
Godiva
-
she
was
an
Anglo-Saxon
noblewoman
who
rode
naked
on
a
horse
through
the
streets
of
Coventry
in
England
in
order
to
gain
a
remission
of
the
oppressive
toll
imposed
by
her
husband
on
his
tenants.
The
name
&quot;peeping
Tom&quot;
for
a
voyeur
comes
from
later
versions
of
this
legend
in
which
a
man
named
Tom
watched
her
ride
and
was
struck
blind.\r\n\r\nFresh
water
pearls,
Swarovski
Austrian
crystals,
and
wood
beads
on
100%
Niobium
Earwires.
Niobium
is
a
pure
metal
that
is
great
for
people
with
sensitivities
to
any
metal
(its
own
element
on
the
periodic
table)-
if
you
only
can
wear
solid
gold,
chances
are
you
can
wear
these
too!\r\n\r\nTotal
length
of
earring
is
about
1.5
inches.\r\n\r\nPlease
see
my
profile
for
return
and
exchange
policies.
My
work
is
guaranteed.\r\n\r\nAll
of
my
professional-quality
jewelry
is
made
with
love
in
a
two-cat,
smoke-free
home.

have
been
collecting
gemstones
for
years,
some
I
have
or
remember
the
info
on,
some
I
don&#39;t.
They
are
all
guaranteed
authentic
as
I
got
them
all
from
reputable
dealers.
I
dabble
in
fine
jewelry
design
very
part
time,
but
with
the
price
of
gold
what
it
is,
I&#39;ve
decided
to
part
with
a
few
of
my
many,
many
gems.
These
could
all
be
wire
wrapped
for
a
reasonable
price
(many
people
on
etsy
do
it
for
a
reasonable
rate)
That
is
just
something
I
have
not
learned
how
to
do
yet
-
which
is
to
your
advantage...\r\nNow
to
the
gem
information.\r\nThis
gemstone
is
stunning.
It&#39;s
guaranteed
to
be
at
least
1.75
carats,
it
measures
10x8mm
and
is
a
faceted
oval.\r\nThe
soft
yellow
is
so
very
pretty,
and
these
stones
are
very
hard
to
come
by!!
These
are
generally
appraised
for
around
$75.00
per
carat
making
the
value
of
this
one
$131.25.
This
really
is
a
great
deal
for
any
collector
out
there!!\r\nIt
will
be
shipped
to
you
in
a
gem
jar.

Kinaree

Canvas
18x18
digital

collage
-
giclee
on
canvas\r\n\r\nThe
&quot;Cloud
Kinaree&quot;
was
inspired
by
and
created
from
photos
taken
from
my
trip
to
Thailand
in
2002.
\r\n\r\n&quot;Kinarees
are
depicted
as
half-bird
half-women
creatures
in
Thai,
Cambodian
and
Lao,
and
Burmese
mythology.
One
of
the
many
creatures
that
inhabit
the
mythical
Himapan
Forest.
The
Kinaree
has
the
head,
torso,
and
arms
of
a
woman
and
the
wings,
tail
and
feet
of
a
swan.
She
is
renowned
for
her
dance,
song
and
poetry,
and
is
a
traditional
symbol
of
feminine
beauty,
grace
and
accomplishment.&quot;\r\n\r\nThe
ancient
Chinese
script
was
taken
from
hand
caligraphy
work
done
in
&quot;walking
style&quot;
by
the
most
famous
of
all
Chinese
caligraphers
-
Wang
Xizhi.
The
caligraphy
is
believed
to
be
about
1,700
years
old.
Since
the
dialect,
charachters
and
meanings
have
changed
so
much
over
the
years
and
the
entire
document
is
no
longer
intact
-
the
exact
translation
is
unknown.
It
is
believed
to
be
a
portion
of
a
letter
written
in
poetic
style.
\r\n\r\nThe
use
of
the
clouds,
leaves,
a
mythological
Kinaree
and
the
ancient
unknown
script
of
the
greatest
Chinese
caligrapher
to
have
ever
lived
is
a
tribute
to
Asian
Art,
myth,
beauty
and
the
unknown.\r\n\r\n18x18&quot;
giclée
on

(gallery
wrapped)\r\nThis
edition
is

to
50\r\n\r\nI
hand
stretch
each
canvas
over
wooden
stretcher
bars
\r\nin
a
&quot;gallery
wrap&quot;
style
so
that
the
artwork
can
be
enjoyed
with
or
without
a

The
canvas
is
sealed
with
a
gloss
UV
spray
to
protect
the
work
from
fading,
dust
and
humidity.
All
limited

are

The

attached.
An
artist
signed
certificate
of
authenticity
accompanies
each
limited
edition.
No
print
edition
exceeds
a
quantity
of
50
so
that
each
piece
is
truly
&quot;limited&quot;
and
collectible.
You

me
in

for
the
edition
number
(etsy

otherwise
it
will
be
provided
with
your
order
confirmation.\r\n\r\nWhat
is
a
giclee?\r\n\r\nA
giclée
(zhee-CLAY),
is
an
individually
produced,
high-resolution,
high
tech
reproduction
done
on
a
professional
large
format
printer.
Giclées
can
be
printed
on
any
number
of
archival
media
including
canvas.
Giclées
are
superior
to
traditional
lithography
in
nearly
every
way.
Giclée
fine
\r\nprints
maintain
color
and
quality
15
times
longer
than
a
fine
art
lithograph.
The
colors
are
brighter,
last
longer,
and
are
so
high-resolution
that
they
are
virtually
&#39;continuous
tone&#39;,
rather
than
tiny
dots.
The
range,
or
&quot;gamut&quot;
of
color
for
giclées
is
also
far
beyond
that
of
lithography,
and
details
are
crisper.\r\n\r\nGiclée
prints
should
last
decades
under
proper
care
and
are
now
being
collected
by
museums.\r\n\r\nPlease

knitted
beaded
fringe
skinny
scarf
Just
because
it&#39;s
cold
in
my
neck
of
the
woods
doesn&#39;t
mean
we
can&#39;t
wear
pretty
scarves!
These
ones
are
a
cross
between
a
scarf
and
a
necklace
-
they&#39;re
trimmed
with
a
fringe
of
beads!
You&#39;ve
got
a
choice
of
four
colors
to
pick
from.
There&#39;s
a
soft
seafoam
green,
a
bolder
turquoise,
a
deep,
rich
violet
&
a
magenta-tinged
wildflower
-
just
let
me
know
which
color
you&#39;d
like
in
your
email.\r\n\r\n
The
scarves
have
been
knitted
out
of
hand-dyed
cotton
chenille
yarn.
Due
to
the
hand-dying
process,
the
color
is
softly
varigated.
Very
trendy...
and
to
top
it
off
I
hand
stitched
a
beaded
fringe
using
glass
beads.
Due
to
to
stretchy
nature
of
knitting
the
length
&
width
are
approximately
3
inches
wide
by
55
inches
long.\r\n\r\n
Made
in
my
own
smoke-free
studio.

You
Talking
To
Me
Teapot
Attitude
and
character
is
all
about
this
high-fired
tenmoku
teapot.
Extra
long
spout
and
ruffled
skirt
(bottom)
lets
you
know
this
pot
knows
where
it
is.
The
body
has
been
thrown
on
a
potters
wheel
and
then
altered.
The
spout,
handle
and
lid
are
handbuilt
additions.
My
personal
chop
(logo)
is
on
the
bottom
of
the
handle.
It
looks
like
a
flying
W.
Hand
washing
recommended.
The
container
part
(not
including
the
lid)
is
around
7.5&quot;
tall
and
around
3.5&quot;
wide
at
the
base.
The
spout
stands
10&quot;
high.
Does
it
pour?
No
way.
With
this
much
good
looks,
who
needs
to
work?

One
of
several
Class

I
have
with
the
classic
blue
toile
pattern;
the
color
of
the
ribbon
ties
and
lining
vary.\r\n\r\nWrap
your
gift
for
a
housewarming,
birthday,
anniversary,
dinner
party....so
many
occasions!\r\n\r\nThink
about
buying
several
at
one
time---I
have
lots
of
choices
for
many
occasions---then
you’ll
have
enough
for
what
you
need
throughout
the
year.
Price
is
$7.00
for
one,
and
if
you
purchase
any
4
Class
Wraps
at
one
time
from
my
shop,
each
will
be
only
$5.00....quite
the
deal!\r\n\r\nIf
you
purchase
4
at
one
time,
I&#39;ll
refund
the
discount
to
you
after
you
pay
in
paypal.
Shipping
is
only
$2
whether
you
purchase
one
or
four.\r\n\r\nClass
Wraps
can
be
used
for
wine,
liquor,
cooking
oil,
candy,
soaps,
candle----a
soft
and
unique
wrap
for
many
items.
Fully
lined,
12
1\\\\/2
inches
long.
All
bottoms
on
the
class
wraps
are
squared
for
a
tailored,
crisp
look.\r\n\r\nThink
about
it...what
would
you
rather
receive
when
someone
brings
a
gift
to
your
home:
a
bottle
dropped
in
a
noisy
paper
bag
or
a
classy
wrap
like
this?
It
is
a
part
of
your
gift
and
meant
to
be
given
again!\r\n\r\nSorry,
bottle
of
wine
not
included.\r\n_________________________________________________\r\n\r\nAll

Many,
but
not
all,
of
my

made
from

The
benefit
to
you:
each

not
absolutely
unique.

The
amber
colored
faceted
15mm
long,
followed
by
two
sterling
tube
beads
from
Bali
and
a
hand
blown
glass
bead.
An
8
mm
tiger
eye
round
bead
finishes
this
stunning
piece
off\r\n\r\nI’ve
tested
the
length
here
on
this
car
bling
mirror
charm
and
it
situates
itself
perfectly
in
between
the
mirror
and
the
dashboard
and
will
be
safe
even
on
sudden
turns.
Hold
the
tiger
tail
part
of
the
charm
on
the
left
hand
side
of
the
mirror
arm
with
your
left
hand,
with
your
right
hand,
take
the
bottom
of
the
charm
and
bring
it
up
and
over
the
mirror
arm
on
the
right
hand
side,
threading
it
through
the
loop
and
letting
it
come
down
the
other
side
to
hang.
Simple
and
easy!\r\n

Gemstone
Details\r\nJade
or
&quot;yu&quot;
as
it
is
called
in
China,
truly
is
one
name
for
two
separate
gems
with
similar
characteristics.
The
first
being
Jadeite,
the
second
Nephrite,
both
are
indeed
&quot;Jade&quot;.
\r\n\r\nIt
was
in
1863
when
the
two
stones
were
recognized
separately.
Nephrite
is
more
common,
but
both
are
tough,
fine-grained
rocks,
suitable
for
carving.
\r\n\r\nJadeite,
though,
made
up
of
interlocking
,granular
pyroxene
crystals,
occurs
in
a
wide
range
of
colors,
such
as
green,
lilac,
white,
pink,
brown,
red,
blue,
black,
orange
and
yellow.
Jadeite
commonly
has
a
dimpled
surface
when
polished.
\r\n\r\nJadeite
is
found
in
metamorphic
rock
as
as
well
as
alluvial
pebbles
or
boulders.
Some
of
the
largest
sources
for
jadeite
is
Myanmar,
which
has
supplied
China
with
translucent
imperial
jade
for
over
200
years.\r\n\r\nMystical
Properties:\r\nJade
is
a
gemstone
of
much
history,
it
has
been
part
of
Asian
philosophy
for
centuries.
It
is
often
called
the
&quot;dream
stone&quot;
for
its
ability
to
help
one
access
the
non-physical
spirit
realms.
It
is
a
protective
stone,
and
acts
as
a
ward
against
negative
energies.
\r\n\r\nThis
is
a
stone
that
can
help
you
to
attain
your
goals
and
dreams,
instilling
resourcefulness,
and
allowing
you
to
see
past
your
self
imposed
limitations
and
manifest
your
ideas
into
the
physical
world.\r\n\r\nJade,
considered
a
very
lucky
stone,
facilitates
peace
and
harmony
between
the
mental,
physical,
emotional
and
spiritual
aspects
of
ones
life.
When
all
of
these
aspects
operate
in
harmony
and
balance,
goals
become
easier
to
reach.\r\n\r\nIt
is
said
to
promote
courage,
compassion,
justice,
generosity,
humility,
wealth
and
longevity,
to
lead
a
richer
more
fulfilling
life.\r\n\r\nLavender
is
known
to
assist
with
fresh
ideas
and
creativity.
It
is
said
to
bring
psychic
understanding
of
ones
dreams,
and
to
aid
in
recovering
form
any
negative
love
situation.

ASYMETRICAL

PENDANT
NECKLACE
N7037-
Completely
Metal
Free
This
is
a
totally
METAL
FREE
necklace.
Just
because
you
can&#39;t
wear
metal,
doesn&#39;t
mean
that
you
can&#39;t
wear
jewelry.
The
pendant,
and
toggle,
are
made
from
polymer
clay.
The
necklace
is
strung
with
green
and
bronze
glass
beads
on
cord.\r\n\r\nThe
copper
sections
are
copper
acrylic
paint.
Just
in
case
the
paint
really
does
contain
copper,
these
sections
have
been
sealed
in
two
coats
of
transparent
liquid
polymer
clay.
The
entire
piece
has
been
coated
with
varnish
for
protection.\r\n\r\nThe
necklace
measures
22&quot;
long.
The
pendant
measures
2
1\\\\/4&quot;
wide
x
3&quot;
long.\r\n\r\nI

Wire
Wrapped
Amber
Pendant
with
Chain
ps083
I
made
this
pendant
by
wrapping
an
amber
cabochon
in
sterling
silver
wire.
This
type
of
amber
is
called
&quot;assembled.&quot;
It
is
produced
by
assembling
bits
of
natural
amber
to
make
a
larger
piece.
Amber
is
extremely
lightweight
(it
feels
a
lot
like
plastic).\r\n\r\nThe
pendant
measures
18mm
by
25mm.
It
measures
approximately
1
3\\\\/8
inches
(33mm)
in
overall
length.\r\n\r\nThis
pendant
comes
with
a
1.5mm
sterling
silver
diamond-cut
curb
chain.
Please
let
me
know
if
you
would
like
a
16&quot;
(40cm),
18&quot;
(45cm),
or
20&quot;
(50cm)
chain
when
you
check
out.
If
you
do
not
specify,
I
will
send
you
an
18&quot;
chain.\r\n\r\n--------------------\r\nAll

intended

It&#39;s
in
like
new
condition
except

mark

more

so
I
am
selling
the
book.
I
want
to
devote
space
and
time
to
handmade
items
for
Etsy
so
I
am
selling
anything
extra
in
my
sewing
and
crafting
room.
Thanks
for
your
interest.\r\n\r\nThis
book

via

In
pretty
pastel
colours
reminiscent
of
Spring
are
these
delightful
hand-embellished
denim
jeans
for
girls.
I&#39;ve
aptly
named
them
&quot;Little
Sunbeam&quot;
for
the
captivating
designs
on
the
fabrics.
The
paisley
print
is
a
Kaffe
Fasset
design
and
the
rest
are
by
Felicity
Miller.
So
pretty!\r\n\r\nAvailable
in
girls&#39;
sizes
2T-3X
(but
not
limited
to
these
sizes)
–
**jeans
will
be
provided
unless
you
prefer
to
provide
your
own
-
each
pair
of
jeans
is
unique
whether
I
make
two
pairs
or
twelve
pairs!
\r\n\r\n**Please
note
that
the
style
of
jeans
I
supply
may
differ
from
those
pictured
in
the
listing.
They
may
be
boot
cut,
slightly
flared,
flared
or
straight
leg,
may
or
may
not
have
an
adjustable
waistband,
depending
on
availability.
However,
I
try
to
purchase
only
brand-name
products,
with
zipper
or
button
fly
and
patch
pockets
on
the
rear**\r\nFabrics
are
applied
to
existing
jeans.
I
purchase
brand-name
products
from
a
variety
of
sources
-
consignment
stores,
clearance
racks,
etc.
Some
are
donated
by
friends
whose
children
have
outgrown
them.
No
matter
the
source,
all
jeans
are
freshly
laundered
before
they
are
added
to
my
inventory.\r\n\r\nAll
garments
are
made
with
machine
washable
cotton.
Simply
turn
the
garment
inside
out
to
wash
and
tumble
dry
as
normal!
These
babies
are
tough!\r\n\r\nFor

Triple
Charm
Ceramic
Pendant
This
ceramic
pendant
is
made
up
of
three
hand
rolled,
cut
&
painted

is
a
1\\\\/2&quot;
round,
white
charm
with
a
small
peace
sign
painted
in
a
brilliant
fired
silver
paint.
Next

around

Baby
Blanket
in
Rodeo
(with
Free
Burpie
Set)
Is
there
anything
better
than
a
freebie?
Me
thinks
not.
This
blanket
comes
with
a
set
of
two
matching
burpcloths.
The
burp
cloths
are
made
with
extra
absorbent
Gerber
prefolded
Birdseye
cloth
diapers
-
the
kind
with
the
extra
padding
in
the
center
-
and
finished
with
our
carefully
selected
fabric.
\r\n\r\n**********************\r\n
\r\nThe
perfect
set
for
the
buckaroo
in
your
life.
This
fabric
is
so
fun
and
the
white
dot
minkee
backing
makes
the
blanket
so
cozy.
The
generous
cut
of
this
29”x34”
blanket
makes
it
perfect
as
a
crib
blanket.
Or
lay
it
on
the
floor
as
your
precious
one
works
on
tummy
time
-
however
you
use
it,
baby
is
sure
to
love
it!
\r\n\r\nAll
of
our
baby
blankets
are
made
from
delicious
minkee
on
one
side
and
a
whimsical
cotton
print
on
the
other.
Baby
will
love
being
wrapped
in
the
softness
and
warmth
that
minkee
provides
and
will
be
enthralled
with
the
fun
colors
and
patterns
of
our
carefully
selected
cotton.
And
mom
will
\r\nlove
the
stylish
look
of
our
modern
blankets.
All
of
our
products
are
made
with
pre-shrunk
cotton
and
are
top-stitched
for
durability.
\r\n\r\nBlanket
is
ready
to
ship
and
comes
tied
in
an
eco-friendly
fabric-scrap
ribbon.\r\n\r\nSpend
your
time
caring
for
the
baby
–
not
the
blanket.\r\nOur
products
are
100%
machine
washable.
Tumble
dry
on

petunia
These
dangling
beauties
were
the
product
of
a
lazy
day
spent
in
the
sunshine
picking
flowers.
I
was
highly
disappointed
by
the
lack
of
petunias
in
my
garden
so
I
thought
I’d
create
some
of
my
own.\r\n\r\nThey
start
with
two
creamy
&#39;serpentine
olive&#39;
jade
tapered
tube
beads;
these
are
a
sultry
green
with
wispy
swirls
of
white
and
black.
\r\n\r\nThese
are
followed
by
droplet
shaped
pink
glass
beads,
which
are
fantastically
luminescent
and
pick
up
different
colors
in
the
light.
\r\n\r\nFinally,
the
earrings
are
topped
with
two
dusty
rose
colored
Czech
fire
polish
beads
and
hung
from
sterling
silver
ear
wires.
My
dear
petunia’s
are
a
little
less
than
two
inches
in
length.\r\n\r\n\r\nAll
items
from
cucchiaio
are
carefully
packaged
to
keep
them
safe
during
shipping.
I
usually
ship
within
a
day
and
send
all
items
with
Delivery
Confirmation!\r\n\r\nGift

This
listing
is
for
one
ORIGINAL
3x4&quot;
Polaroid
image
transfer
in
an
8x10&quot;
archival
mat.
Unmatted
PRINTS
of
this
transfer
are
available
in
sizes
from
4x6&quot;
to
16x20&quot;
on
photographic
paper.
Please
see
shop
announcement
for
sizes
and
price.
To
purchase
please
go
to
the
section
entitled
&quot;Prints&quot;,
buy
the
generic
listing
for
the
size
you
want
and
include
the
name
of
this
image
in
the
Note
to
Seller.
I
will
contact
you
within
48
hours
(usually
much
sooner)
to
confirm
your
selection.\r\n\r\nABOUT
THE
PROCESS:\r\nTo
begin
this
unique
photographic
art
I
capture
an
image
on
slide
film.
The
slide
is
then
projected
onto
Polaroid
pack
film
which
is
peeled
prematurely.
The
“waste”
side
of
the
film
pack,
which
contains
processing
chemicals,
is
then
placed
face
down
onto
wet
watercolor
paper
and
brayed
(rolled
over
with
a
printmaking
brayer).
The
result
is
a
one-of-a-kind
hand-pulled
photographic
transfer
of
the
original
slide
image.
The
original
image
can
be
transferred
an
unlimited
number
of
times
but
each
resulting
transfer
will
always
vary
from
the
last.
Each
original
transfer
is
approximately
3”
by
4”
in
size
and
is
hand
signed
(both
on
the
image
and
the
mat).
Each
comes
in
an
8x10&quot;
hand
cut
(by
me)
archival
museum
quality
mat.\r\n\r\nThe
first
photograph
is
of
the
image
as
it
looks
through
the
mat
opening.
The
second
image
is
an
example
of
a
matted
transfer
(it
is
a
generic
image
so
may
not
match
the
image
in
photos
1).
The
third
image
is
an
example
of
the
matted
transfer
in
a
frame
(it
is
a
generic
image
so
may
not
match
the
image
in
photos
1).\r\n\r\nPlease
note
that
any
copyright
information
you
see
on
this
image
will
not
be
present

SOULARA
Soulara
H:
6.5&quot;
W:
2.5&quot;
Base:
2.5&quot;\r\n\r\nBecause
of
molten
glass&#39;
ability
to
demonstrate
nature&#39;s
affinity
for
balance;
holding
it&#39;s
shapes
under
what
seem
to
be
impossible
odds,
I
created
Solara
as
a
spontaneous
inspiration
of
disregard
for
apparent
laws
of
physics.\r\n\r\nAs
inspiration
courses
through
me,
I
find
a
deep
fascination
in
the
spontaneous
nature
of
glass.
Allowing
the
glass
to
tell
you
where
to
go
can
be
very
rewarding,
as
well
as
intrigueing
with
such
a
vast
amount
of
diverse
outcomes.

Diptych
-
silver
gelatin
matted
photographs
This
is
a
diptych
which
contrasts
staircases
from
the
San
Francisco
Center
and
the
Vatican
Museum.
Guess
which
one
was
designed
by
Michaelangelo?
See
the
related
listing
titled
&quot;Oculus
Diptych&quot;
in
my
store.\r\n\r\nThe
images
are
two
original
6x9
black
and
white
photographs
archivally
processed,
selenium
toned,
matted
and
ready
for
framing.
The
matte
size
is
16x20.
The
photographs
are
hand-made
by
traditional
wet
darkroom
methods
using
the
finest
silver
gelatin
papers
and
materials.
They
are
NOT
inkjet
prints.
The
low-res
scans
on
the
web
don&#39;t
do
justice
to
the
original
print.
It
will
be
shipped
by
Canada
Post
in
flat
packaging
and
protected
by
cardboard
to
ensure
it
arrives
safely.\r\n\r\nThe
photograph
is
shipped
unframed,
however,
the
image
above
will
give
you
some
idea
of
what
it
could
look
like
when
framed.\r\n\r\nPlease

Pui
Coasters,
The
Sunset
Andaman
THE
ANDAMAN
COLLECTION\r\n
\r\nInspired
by
the
stunning
colors
and
vibes
of
the
Andaman
Sea,
a
beautiful,
South
East
Asia,
tropical
open
sea
in
my
home
country,
Thailand,
and
a
delicate
touch
of
the
old
English
doilies,
Pui
Coasters
are
designed
to
generate
the
artistic
sense
for
everyday
living.\r\n\r\nThink
of
your
party
table
as
a
blank
canvas
and
let
your
imaginations
fly,
put
on
some
colors,
mix
and
match
old
and
new,
tough
and
soft,
to
create
a
distinctive
sense,
you
would
be
surprised
how
much
creativity
hidden
inside
you.\r\n\r\nWith
a
basic
crochet,
I
designed
a
simple
crochet
pattern
for
these
particular,
practical
coasters
which
look
very
nice
on
your
party
table,
yet
they
can
be
treated
as
the
art
object
as
my
friends
did
-
instead
of
putting
them
on
the
party
table,
they
decided
to
hang
them
on
the
wall
and
that
what
I
call
&quot;The
innovative
way
of
living.&quot;
They
came
in
a
very
nice
package
designed
by
me.\r\n\r\n-Measure
4
inches
in
diameter\r\n\r\n-These
Andaman
Collection
has
four
different
sets
of
colors.\r\n\r\n-There
is
a
set
of
four.
If
you
would
like
to
combine
the
colors
in
one
set
please
convo
me.\r\n\r\n-
Hand
crocheted
with
100%
Mercerized
Cotton
thread
and
Japanese
glass
beads.\r\n\r\n-
Prefer
hand-watched,
and
can
be
put
on
light
pressed
under
a
sheet
of
cloth
if
you
like.\r\n\r\nThey
are
meant
to
be
a
very
nice
gift
for
people
who
appreciate
the
art
of
handmade
and
understand
the
heart
of
craftsmanship.
\r\n\r\nPlease
check
out

Andaman
Red
Coral,
Andaman
Shells
and

collection.\r\n..........................................................................................\r\n\r\nNote

Vintage
Pair
of
Wood
Beehive
Salt
and
Pepper
Shakers
Souvenir
Medford
Oregon
Souvenirs
from
Medford,
Oregon,
I
found
these
at
an
estate
of
a
salt
and
pepper
shaker
collector.
\r\n\r\nThey
are
made
of
wood
and
beehive
shaped
with
horizontal.
The
have
Medford,
Ore
stamped
on
them
as
well
as
a
door
and
2
small
flying
objects.
They
are
about
1
1\\\\/2&quot;
high
and
about
1
1\\\\/2&quot;
in
diameter
at
the
bottom.
One
of
them
is
missing
it&#39;s
cork
stopper.
The
other
has
some
blemishes
on
the
side
where
it&#39;s
missing
some
sealer.
They
were
probably
inexpensive
souvenirs
at
the
time,
so
they
have
a
few
blemishes.
They&#39;re
still
pretty
cute.

The
Belly
Dancer,
Mini
Pot
A
sweet
mix
of
blues
and
beads
and
sequins
to
remind
you
of
easy-going
fun.
A
small
amount
of
paint
sanded
from
edges,
and
some
wobble
to
the
decor
to
give
an
older,
perhaps
tired
appearance;
as
some
of
us
old
Belly
Dancers
have
acquired
with
the
beauty
of
aging.
Yet,never
letting
go
of
having
fun!\r\n\r\nSuper
for
using
on
the
dresser
or
in
the
bathroom,
to
hold
small
makeup
brushes,
elastics,
cotton
swabs,
etc.\r\nSuper
to
keep
on
your
desk
for
elastics,
spare
change,
etc.\r\nFun
for
the
young
lady
of
the
house
to
hold
trinkets
and
treasures
in,
on
her
bedroom
dresser
or
shelf.\r\nThe
uses
just
keep
on
coming.\r\n\r\nThis

about
2+1\\\\/2&quot;
across
the
top

3&quot;
tall.
Sits
on
a
coordinated
base.

of
puffs
of
tulle!
Those
were
wonderful
hours
of
shared
creativity.
Nora
is
gone
now,
but
her
teaching
lives
on
through
my
work.
I
was
blessed
to
have
known
her
and
to
have
been
loved
by
her.
This
brooch
is
in
the
style
Nora
taught
me
except
that
I
have
used
my
french
beaded
flowers
and
leaves
in
place
of
the
silks
that
we
used
so
long
ago.
All
of
the
beads
are
glass!
Tiny
beads
of
matte
finished
translucent
peach
glass
create
a
softness
in
the
roses
and
their
buds.
Light
green
calyxes
and
leaves
combined
with
pearl
white
glass
Baby&#39;s
Breath
create
contrast
and
texture
in
the
composition.
One
leaf
of
pearl
white
glass
beaded
in
Russian
style
and
a
large
organza
puffy
peach
bow
bring
additional
elegance
and
softness.
The
corsage
brooch
has
a
long
pin
clasp
at
back
(see
Picture
of
back
view)
and
all
of
the
stems
are
wrapped
in
a
satin
metallic
green
floss
that
adds
an
element
of
jewelry
style
sparkle.
Hours
of
painstaking
work
are
exhibited
here
in
five
peach
roses,
2
peach
buds,
calyxes
ornamenting
each
flower
base,
a
total
of
six
leaves,
and
two
sprays
of
Baby&#39;s
Breath
have
been
individually
prepared
for
this
design.
All
are
hand
beaded
on
non-tarnishing
wire
for
a
very
long
enduring
composition.
If
the
bow
gets
tatty
over
the
years,
It
may
be
cut
away
and
replaced
effortlessly.
French
beaded
ornaments
have
a
history
dating
back
as
far
as
the
eighteenth
century
and
for
a
time
almost
disappeared.
The
few
books
that
are
available
offer
instruction
for
creating
work
as
ornamentation
for
the
home.
I
have
altered
construction
to
make
the
work
more
suitable
for
jewelry
application.
Overall
size
of
the
brooch
is
six
inches
by
3
inches.
The
design
may
be
elegantly
employed
at
the
belt,
evening
bag,
hat,
or
shoulder.
Also
for
pulling
up
a
swag
of
skirt
on
an
evening
dress
it
would
be
divine!

Renaissance
Wench
Pirate
Gown
Dress
Costume
Corset
While
wearing
this
ensemble,
you
will
be
the
image
of
true
pirate
elegance!
\r\n\r\nThe
Reversible
Bodice\r\n\r\nThis
bodice
is
simply
breathtaking!
It
is
made
with
an
incredible
ruby
red
and
gold
brocade
with
tiny
hints
of
blue
and
sage.
The
light
plays
beautifully
on
this
amazing
high
end
fabric.
The
cap
sleeved
bodice
is
reversible
to
deep
black
cotton
canvas.
As
with
all
of
my
bodices,
there
are
six
pieces
of
spring
steel
boning
to
give
you
the
proper
Renaissance
silhouette.
There
is
black
lacing
through
professionally
set
black
grommets.\r\n\r\nThis
bodice
will
be
custom
tailored
to
your
measurements.
\r\n\r\nThe
Skirt\r\n\r\nThe
skirt
is
100%
cotton
in
rich
black.
It
has
a
drawstring
waistband,
and
measures
43&quot;
from
waist
to
serged
hem.
The
circumference
of
the
skirt
is
155&quot;.
\r\n\r\nThe
bleached
muslin
long
sleeve
chemise,
the
belt,
and
the
pewter
tankard
are
not
included
in
this
listing,
but
each
of
these
can
be
purchased
separately
in
my
shop.\r\n\r\nAlterations
are
the
responsibility
of
the
Buyer.
\r\n\r\nAll
seams
are
serged
and
finished
to
prevent
fraying.
\r\n\r\nA
Note
on
Measurements:\r\n\r\nWhen
choosing
a
size
you
should
never
rely
on
your
bra
or
pant
size,
always
grab
a

is
the
second
of

pendants

made
exploring
this
theme.\r\n\r\nThis
one
uses
sewing
as
a
metaphor.
The
crack
is
sewn
with
an

stitch,
and
an
irregular,
worn
hole
is
patched
with
silver
mesh.\r\n\r\nThis

hold
a

of
items:
traditional
pictures
or
hair,
or
pads
of
felt
that
can
hold
perfumes
or

Babys
Bottom
Bars
Baby’s
Bottom
Bars
contain
Shea
Butter
and
Sweet
Almond
Oil.
They
have
a
very
sweet
baby
powder
fragrance
and
will
leave
your
skin
feeling
like
a
baby’s
bottom.\r\n\r\nSweet
almond
oil
has
high
amounts
of
vitamin
A,
and
is
a
natural
moisturizer
that
is
very
beneficial
to
dry,
chapped
hands
and
feet.
It
is
an
excellent
skin
softener,
conditioner
and
a
great
moisturizer.
Sweet
almond
oil
lotion
is
commonly
used
to
relieve
skin
itch,
irritation
and
dryness
and
is
effective
with
all
skin
types.
The
benefits
of
almond
oil
come
from
the
fact
that
it
is
high
in
minerals,
protein,
naturally
occurring
vitamins
(A,
B1,
B2,
B6
and
E),
and
fatty
acids.
Sweet
almond
oil
is
easily
absorbed
into
the
skin
leaving
it
soft
and
smooth.
This
oil
also
promotes
a
younger
looking
complexion
and
may
relieve
muscular
aches
and
pains.\r\n\r\nShea
Butter
nourishes
the
skin
with
Vitamins
A,
E
and
F.
Vitamins
A
and
E
help
maintain
the
skin
and
keep
it
clear
and
healthy.
They
are
particularly
helpful
for
sun
damaged
skin.
They
help
prevent
premature
wrinkles
and
facial
lines.
Vitamin
F
acts
as
a
skin
protector
and
rejuvenator.
It
soothes
rough,
dry
or
chapped
skin
and
helps
soften
dry
or
damaged
hair.
Shea
Butter
can
also
be
used
to
aid
in
the
prevention
of
stretch
marks!!!!!
\r\n\r\nWe
added
ground
oats
for
a
gentle
exfoliate!!\r\n\r\n\r\nThis
bar
weighs
in
at
about
6
ounces.
We
also
have
it
available
in
loafs.
This
bar
is
sold
individually
at

earring
of
da
quarter
club
not
sure
what
to
give
that
special
someone
for
that
exceptional
holiday
–
Christmas,
Chanukah,
President’s
Day,
or
say
Bubble
Wrap®
Appreciation
Day
(yes
it
is
an
actual
day
–
the
29th
of
January
thank
you
very
much!)
–
well
vintagecookie
has
the
solution
and
the
gift
for
you,
er,
them…the
earring
da
month
club!
\r\n\r\nsure,
sure
we
were
skeptical
of
the
“of
the
month
clubs”
I
mean
hey
it
didn’t
work
out
to
well
for
clark
w.
griswold
-
http:\\\\/\\\\/www.youtube.com\\\\/watch?v=1K8-kNuDgoA
–
but
this
club’s
different.
For
starters
it’s
not
an
“of
THE
month”
its
an
“of
DA
month”
club
–
which
makes
us
a
little
less
formal
–
more
casual,
which
we
think

scary
(ish)
upcycled
paperclay
shiney
white
bunny
mask
This
scary
shiny
white
bunny
(scarey
because
of
the
nostrils-
but
who
said
scary
isn&#39;t
fun!!)
was
individually
hand
sculpted
from
upcycled
paper
clay
(
a
mix
of
recycled
papers,
junk
mail,
clay,
recycled
and
new
acrylic
paints.
\r\n\r\nThe
moveable
whiskers
are
upcycled
copper
wire.
The
strings
on
the
sides
are
embedded
into
the
mask
and
comes
with
elastic
at
the
ends
for
the
perfect
fit.\r\n\r\nThe
mask
fits
most
people/children
and
measures
8&quot;
from
string
to
string\r\n3&quot;
from
middle
of
the
forhead
-
tip
of
nose\r\n4&quot;
long
ears\r\n\r\nWhen
warmed
with
heat
(hairdryer
for
instance)
it
stretches
to
fit
bigger
faces
and
shrink
to
fit
smaller
faces.\r\n\r\nThis
is
not
the
exact
bunny
you
will
receive...
but
pretty
darn
close.
If
you
would
like
to
see
a
picture
of
the
one
you
will
get
just
convo
me
and
I
will
send
you
a
pic!\r\n

Vintage
Noble
Metal
Whistle
on
Chain,
Police,
Referee,
Teacher
This
is
a
beautiful
nickled
chrome
whistle
on
a
heavy
ball
chain.
It
was
made
in
Japan
and
was
well
constructed
with
nice
attention
to
detail.
It
has
a
great
sound
with
the
wooden
ball
creating
reverb.
There
are
a
few
tiny
dents
and

&quot;We&#39;re
Pals&quot;\r\n\r\nTwo
little
Maine
Coon
kittens
play
together\r\n\r\nAt
85,
my
mother
decided
she
would
like
to
try
her
hand
at
art.
ACEO&#39;s
are
the
perfect
size
for
her,
because
they
are
quick
and
portable,
and
she
is
really
enjoying
her
new-found
hobby.
I
hope
you
will
enjoy
her
art,
too!\r\n\r\nThis
is
an
original
image,
hand-drawn
and
&quot;painted&quot;
in
prismacolor
pencils
on
acid-free,
Canson,
Mi-Teintes
Museum
Quality
paper.
The
size
is
2
1\\\\/2&quot;
by
3
1\\\\/2&quot;,
the
standard
size
of
an
ACEO.
The
surface
of
the
painting
has
been
sprayed
with
an
acid-free
sealer.
The
painting
is
titled,
signed
and
dated
on
the
back
by
the
artist
and
has
her
initials
and
year
of
production
on
the
front
of
the
card.\r\n\r\nMonitors
can
vary
in
reproducing
color,
so
there
may
be
subtle
differences
between
what
you
see
on
your
monitor
and
what
appears
in
the
actual
painting.
Also,
my
scanner
does
tend
to
miss
some
of
the
fine
detail
and
shading
the
in
the
painting.
In
general,
these
cards
tend
to
be
clearer,
more
vibrant
and
more
detailed
that
the
auction
picture
shows.\r\n\r\nThe
painting
is
copyrighted
by
the
artist.
The
buyer
purchases
the
painting
only,
and
does
not
purchase
the
right
to
reproduce
the
image.\r\n\r\nThis
ACEO
will
be
securely
packed
in
a
hard
plastic
&quot;top
loader&quot;
and
reinforced
with
cardboard
for
shipping.
There
is
a
$2.25
mailing
charge
for
USPS
First
Class
mailing
within
the
United
States.
Insurance
is
at
the
request
and
the
expense
of
the
buyer;
however,
I
am
unable
to
offer
insurance
for
international
shipping.
I
am
always
happy
to
combine
shipping
for
multiple
items
purchased
within
5
days
of
one
another.\r\n\r\nAbout

RECENT
TESTIMONIALS
ABOUT
THESE
ENCHANTING
INVITATIONS:
\r\nWhen
I
opened
my
package
today,
my
heart
STOPPED!
These
are
by
FAR
and
AWAY
the
most
beautiful
invitations
I&#39;ve
EVER
seen,
and
I&#39;m
not
exaggerating!!
I
saw
the
picture
in
your
ad
for
these,
and
the
entire
time
through
ordering
them
and
personalizing
them,
I
kept
thinking
in
the
back
of
my
mind,
there
HAD
to
be
a
catch.
I
just
kept
thinking
that
when
I&#39;d
receive
them
they
wouldn&#39;t
be
as
nice,
or
something!
Even
after
you
were
so
wonderful
and
nice
to
me
with
my
requests,
I
just
kept
thinking
there
was
no
possible
way
I
could
get
these
absolutely
stunning
invitations
for
THIS
price!
Sure
enough,
when
I
opened
them,
my
heart
STOPPED!
I
was
breathless
and
my
eyes
teared
up,
these
are
much
much
more
than
I
could
have
ever
dreamed
them
to
be!
You
have
outdone
yourself
HandyKane,
these
invitations
look
like
they
came
straight
out
of
the
PAST,
they
look
so
authentic
and
Royal,
you
have
truly
made
me
feel
like
a
Princess.
I
can
never
thank-you
enough,
I&#39;ll
definitely
be
back
for
more
of
your
items,
thank-you
so
so
so
much!\r\nTonya

\r\nI
would
like
to
share
my
thoughts
(our
testimonial)
with
you
and
your
website
about
our
invitation
order:\r\n\r\nThank
you
so
much
for
our
beautiful
ancient
scroll
invitations.
Not
only
were
we
blown
away,
but
nearly
everyone
who?s
seen
them
have
been
impressed
and
have
commented
on
how
unique
and
amazing
they
are.
One
of
my
friends
has
a
teenage
daughter
who
actually
took
it
to
show
off
at
school
before
my
friend
even
saw
it!
We
are
so
proud
of
them
and
they
are
the
perfect
compliment
to
our
Disneyland
fairy
tale
wedding.
And
it?s
great
to
know
that
you?re
helping
out
Smiletrain.
Your
customer
service
is
excellent
and
turn
around
time
is
fast.
Thanks
again
and
I
look
forward
to
using
HandyKane
again
very
soon
and
in
the
future
for
other
special
events.

Mini
Collaged
Canvas
Original
This
is
an
original
mixed
media
collage
on
stretched
canvas.
The
female
image
has
been
collaged
onto
the
canvas
along
with
ephemera
and
other
papers
in
the
background.
It
has
then
been
detailed
with
inks,
acrylic
paints
and
stampings
to
add
depth
and
texture
to
the
piece.
The
sides
have
been
painted
to
flow
with
the
front
of
the
canvas.
No
need
for
framing.
The
collage
has
been
sealed
with
matte
varnish.
And
embellished
with
miniature
buttons.\r\n________________________________________________\r\nTitle

booklet
These
booklets
are
folded
and
stapled,
black
and
white
xerox
on
paper,
with
paper
covers.
Some
booklets
have
cardstock
covers
with
colored
paper
pages.
Where
indicated,
covers,
and
covers
only,
are
in
full
color.
I
am
selling
a
process,
not
a
product.
The
booklets
are
not
the
&quot;thing&quot;,
but
rather
house
a
virtual
workshop
using
my
process.
The
real
&quot;thing&quot;
is
your
own
expression,
guided
by
my
assignments.\r\n\r\n****\r\n\r\nWestward

the
Pioneering
Spirit
of
Extreme
Journalism
\r\nin
a
Wild
West
Altered
Book
\r\n\r\nSaddle
up
Pardners,
and
prepare
yourself
for
the
ride
of
a
lifetime.
Using
the
Westward
Journey
as
a
theme
we
will
expand
the
process
of
creating
a
mixed
media
book
of
self
expression
or
Extreme
Visual
Journal
.
By
combining
journal
writing
exercises
with
artmaking
assignments
in
an
altered
Book
of
the
Wild
West,
we
will
explore
our
Life’s
Journey
by
deciphering
and
embellishing
the
dusty
and
well
traveled
trail
of
our
experience.
Themes,
such
as
the
Wild
West,
Pioneer
Spirit,
the
Frontier,
Outlaws
and
Bandits,
are
great
tools
to
help
us
focus
inward
by
creating
an
outward
distraction
of
Historical
reference.
You’ll
have
so
much
fun
you
won’t
even
realize
it’s
all
about
self
dialogue,
inner
work,
personal
expression,
and
symbolism.
Uncover
your
Wild
West
Spirit
and
Woman
of
True
Grit
as
we
learn
to
layer
pages
of
text
with
mixed
media
and
Frontier
Days
ephemera.
Join
my
band
of
Outlaws
where
Expression
and
process
are
stressed
as
opposed
to
technique.
Go
West,
Young
Woman,
and
find
the
Spirit
of
yourself.
For
all
levels\\\\/
no
prior
experience
necessary.

Fierce
Necklace
-
OOAK
I
am
woman
hear
me
ROAR.
This
necklace
is
not
for
the
faint
of
heart.
It
is
earthy,
it
is
wild,
it
reminds
me
of
a
prowling
tiger
in
the
jungle.
\r\n\r\nThe
stars
of
this
necklace
are
three
carnelian
coins
in
a
deep
orange
with
interlacing
strands
of
white.
The
coins
are
supported
by
a
cast
of
half
moon
beads
made
from
coconut
shells
sent
to
me
by
my
dear
cousin
who
lives
in
Thailand.
\r\n\r\nIt&#39;s
ethnic,
it&#39;s
fun
and
it
will
bring
out
the
rawness
in
you.\r\n\r\nThis
is
a
one
of
a
kind
necklace
as
these
are
the
only
half
moon
coconut
shells
that
I
have.\r\n\r\nMeasurements:\r\n\r\nLength

asked

Handcrafted
copper
swirl
bee
bracelet
-
ooak
This
is
a
handcrafted,
very
unique,
wire
wrapped
bracelet.
It
is
a
little
bit
larger,
so
will
be
great
for
those
people
who
have
somewhat
larger
hands
or
wrists.
It&#39;s
total
length
is
8
1\\\\/4&quot;.
I
have
a
7
1\\\\/2&quot;
wrist,
and
it
fits
great,
maybe
a
tad
loose.
This
bracelet
has
a
central
medallion
of
amber
colored
glass,
which
reminded
me
of
honey,
or
a
beehive.
There
is
a
bee
buzzing
toward
it
from
either
side,
followed
by
swirls,
which
signify
the
bee&#39;s
movements.
Each
link
is
well
wrapped,
which
means
that
is
should
be
very
secure.
There
are
also
green
raku-type
glass
beads
scattered
around
the
length
of
the
bracelet.
The
clasp
is
a
work
of
art
in
and
of
itself,
and
is
very
large
and
easy
to
hook.
\r\n\r\nPlease
convo
me
if
you
are
interested
in
having
me
make
a
similar
bracelet
in
a
different
color
or
smaller
size.

Bank
You
are
looking
at
a
beautifully
handcrafted
Plastic
Canvas
Teddy
Bear
Coin
Bank.
I
always
call
them
belly
banks
because
you
can
watch
the
money
fill
up
their
bellies.
The
teddy
bear
is
made
with
7
count
plastic
canvas
and
a
high
quality
yarn.
It
was
stitched
with
jade
green,
pink
and
light
green
yarns
making
this
bank
great
for
any
young
kid,
new
baby
or
anyone
who
loves
these
colors.
The
bank
measures
9
½”
high
and
7”
wide.
I
have
several
other
banks
on
sale
but
if
you
don’t
see
the
color
that
you
like
please
let
me
know
I

Spiderman
T-Shirt
Quilt,
Sized
for
a
Twin
or
Full-Sized
Bed
Get
your
Spider-man
on
with
this
webbed
wonder
worship-device.
It&#39;s
just
as
fan-geek
as
anything
I
make,
and
made
with
just
as
much
love
and
humming
of
the
Spidey
theme-song.
We
have
tons
of
these
T-shirt
quilts
in
our
house,
and
so
we
know
that
they&#39;re
soft
and
decorative
and
comfy
enough
for
a
kid&#39;s
bed,
and
sturdy
and
easily-washed
enough
to
get
dragged
around
and
played
with
and
used
for
picnics
by
everyone
from
the
smallest
to
the
largest
Spider-man
fan.\r\n\r\nThis
quilt
measures
40
inches
by
60
inches
and
is
pieced
from
recycled
T-shirts
and
new
cotton
fabric
for
some
of
the
border,
and
backed
and
edged
with
new
baby
blue
fleece.
With
this
quilt,
you
can
show
your
Spider-man
love
and
feel
happily
confident
that
you
have
an
item
that&#39;s
not
mass-market,
but
is
handmade
by
a
happy
stay-at-home
mom
artist
and
is
absolutely
unique
in
this
world.
\r\n\r\nMy
materials
are
always
pre-washed
with
free
and
clear
detergent
in
my
high
efficiency
washing
machine.
The
T-shirt
fronts
are
also
pre-loved
and
come
to
you
with
histories
of
their
own,
in
accordance
with
the
recycling
ethic
that
informs
my
work.
This
also
ensures
that
they&#39;re
soft
and
sturdy,
washable
and
wearable
for
their
new
life
with
you.

Under
Water
The
Fish
Dont
Stink
A
necklace
dedicated
to
the
joy
of
all
the
creatures
under
the
oceans
surface.
Made
of
blue
adventurite
(which
to
me
looks
more
purple
than
blue),
and
moonstone,
this
20&quot;
necklace
has
a
cute
fish
pendant,
which
reminds
me
of
Flounder
from
The
Little
Mermaid.

Amigurumi
Ninja
w\\\\/Detachable
Nun-chucks
and
Katana
This
guy
is
so
awesome!
I
worked
really
hard
on
him,
completely
without
a
pattern.\r\n\r\nHe
stands
about
13
inches
tall
and
is
super
cuddly,
but
you&#39;d
better
watch
out
because,
like
all
ninjas,
he&#39;s
quick
and
unpredictable!
^_^
He
is
made
with
acrylic
and
wool
yarn,
safety
eyes,
and
stuffed
with
Cluster
Stuff.\r\n\r\nHe
comes
with
detachable
nun-chucks
and
a
katana
sword
that
he
can
hold
onto
with
velcro.
The
sword
has
cardboard
inside
so
that
it
will
appear
blade-like.\r\n\r\nHe
is
posed
to
do
a
karate
chop
and
a
kick,
so
he
doesn&#39;t
stand
on
his
own
very
well,
but
is
super
cute
(and
deadly!
^_^)
nonetheless.\r\n\r\nI
worked
very
hard
on
this
little
guy
to
make
him
as
realistic
as
I
possible
could
and
he
is
made
with
a
ton
of
love
and
care.\r\n\r\nHe
does
come
from
a
cat
and
dog
(and
hedgehog!)
friendly
home,
so
please
keep
that
in
mind
if
that&#39;s
an
issue
for
you.\r\n\r\nI
hope
he
will
find
a
home
with
a
ninja
lovin&#39;
person
who
will
enjoy
him
for
a
long,
long
time!\r\n\r\nThank
you!\r\n\r\nRemember,
love
is.\r\n\r\nwww.sayhedgehog.com

a

SILLY
BUTTON...Best

Pins
(Pair-Rect.)
Up
for
your
consideration
are
2
quirky
little
decopague
button
pins
featuring
a
bunch
of
best
friend
dolls.
I
bought
one
of
these
dolls
for
my
daughter,
and
really
want
to
keep
it
for
myself...so
cute!
On
the
2&quot;
round
disk,
I&#39;ve
layered
green
and
yellow
tissue
paper.
The
1.5&quot;
x
2.25&quot;
rectangle
features
orange
and
yellow
tissue
paper.
The
doll
images
are
sealed
under
many
layers
of
mod
podge
and
poly.
sealer.
On
the
back
of
each
is
a
1&quot;
bar
pin.
These
would
look
great
on
a
sweater,
jean
jacket,
backpack,
knit
cap
or
any
other
place
that
needs
some
cuteness.\r\n\r\nPlease
note
that
I&#39;ve
set
up
this
auction
for
US
addresses,
but
am
happy
to
ship
internationally.
Please
convo
me
if
you
have
a
non-US
address,
and
I&#39;ll
change
the
shipping
criteria.
Thanks
for
stopping
by!\r\n\r\n*************THE
BACK
STORY**********************************************************\r\nBack
in
my
undergrad
days,
one
of
my
best
friends
and
I
would
cut
out
phrases
and
pix
from
magazines
and
paste
them
on
sheets
of
posterboard.
We
hung
them
all
over
our
dorm
walls
and
thought
we
are
so
deep
and
artsy
fartsy.
That
was
20+
years
ago
(ouch!)
Fast
forward
to
today,
and
I
still
get
caught
up
in
clever
phrases
and
images
that
appear
in
my
mailbox
in
the
forms
of
catalogs,
junk
mail
and
the
occasional
magazine.
I
haven&#39;t
been
able
to
quell
my
collaging
urges
so
I&#39;ve
decided
to
let
off
some
of
that
steam
here
on
etsy.
I
hope
you
enjoy
these
whimsical
little
buttons...perfect
for
a
Saturday
AM
stroll
to
the
local
farmer&#39;s
market.

The
Maxi
Collection
includes:\r\n\r\n-
BiggieZig:
Manageable
carry-all.\r\n-
BurlyZig:
A
hefty
project
bag
for
creative
folks.\r\n\r\nKnit
in
the
round,
in
stranded
colorwork.
Use
only
two
yarns
per
row
in
a
masterful
method
which
looks
much
fancier
than
it
is.\r\n\r\nThe
colorwork
presents
significant
depth
by
alternating
two
sets
of
solid\\\\/striping
yarns,
one
set
when
the
pattern
&quot;zigs&quot;
to
the
left,
and
the
other
set
when
it
&quot;zags&quot;
to
the
right.
The
bag
base
is
knit
in
a
checkerboard
pattern
(see
detail
photo,
not
pictured
in
main
image).\r\n\r\nThese
bags
have
been
a
hit
at
every
gathering
they
have
graced,
from
the
east
coast
to
the
midwest
and
Texas.
Join
the
fun
and
make
a

you
will
use
faithfully
for

is

for

abstract
paisley
bean
leaf
stamp
I
am
listing
numerous
rubber
stamps
from
my
huge
stash
of
unloved
(sometimes
unused)
stamps.
I
am
selling
each
stamp
for
less
than
its
original
price,
plus
shipping
and
handling.
Please
note
that
any
pixelated
images
are
the
fault
of
my
scanner,
not
of
the
stamps.\r\n\r\nMost
of
my
stamps
are
from
the
90&#39;s,
and
that
means
that
they
are
discontinued.
Some
are
from
companies
that
are
no
longer
in
business.
That
means
that
these
stamps
are
not
the
ones
you
commonly
find
in
the
stores
these
days.
Your
chance
of
finding
something
&quot;different&quot;
in
my
stash
is
pretty
good.\r\n\r\nThis
stamp
measures
about
1.5&quot;
X
3.25&quot;,
and
was
made
by
Rubber
Nature
Art
Stamps.\r\n\r\nRegarding
domestic
shipping:
With
the
new
postal
rates,
it’s
very
hard
to
predict
shipping
costs,
because
it
depends
upon
how
many
stamps
you
buy.
I
generally
ship
priority,
and
I
will
ship
up
to
1
lb
of
stamps
for
$6.
Your
shipping
cost
will
never
exceed
$9.15
per
box,
in
any
case,
because
I
will
use
flat
rate
boxes
to
ship
large
numbers.\r\n\r\n*IF*
you
prefer
shipping
other
than
priority,
please
let
me
know
BEFORE
you
pay,
and
I
will
calculate
your
exact
shipping
cost.
Be
certain
to
include
your
zip
code.\r\n\r\n*****Also,
please
contact
me
BEFORE
paying,
for
actual
shipping
costs
outside
the
US.
I
have
recently
found
that
international
shipping
costs
have
increased
a
LOT,
since
our
new
postal
rates
started
in
May.
First
class
is
the
cheapest
rate
offered
now,
and
4
lbs
is
the
limit
for
first
class.
Anything
over
that
weight
must
travel
Priority,
and
that
*STARTS*
at
$36.

Orange
and
pink
hemp
style
cotton
bracelet
with
three
blue
beads
This
thin
bracelet
is
made
of
four
strands
of
100%
cotton
yarn,which
was
pre
washed
to
prevent
future
shrinking.
\r\n\r\nAlthough
the
material
is
cotton,it
was
made
in
a
style
of
popular
hemp
bracelets.\r\n\r\nThe
colour
of
it
is
bright,orange
on
one
end
and
changing
into
pink
on
the
other
end...This
is
because
the
yarn
it
is
made
of,wasone
of
those
that
are
not
always
the
same
colour
(variegated
yarn).It
gives
the
bracelet
quite
an
interesting
look.\r\n\r\nIn
the
middle
there
are
three
small
light
blue
beads,
big
approx.
3
mm
x
5
mm.The
body
of
the
bracelet
is
16
cm
long
and
thewhole
bracelet
(including
the
side
strings
to
fasten
it
at
your
wrist)
is
42
cm
long.
Of
course,
if
this
would
be
too
long
for
your
wrist,
you
can
shorten
them
easily
after
realizing
what
length
you
need.\r\n\r\nAll
of
my
bracelets
are
handmade
by
me
and
shipped
from
Czech
republic,
during
summer
and
holidays
also
from
Slovakia.\r\n\r\nIf
you
have
any
questions,
do
notbe
afraid
to
convo
me,I
am
convo
friendly.

Hand-painted
Floral
Pendant
I
purchased
two
of
these
hand-painted
pendants
for
a
song--now
I&#39;m
destashing
so
you
get
the
savings!
I&#39;m
not
sure
what
this
pendant
is
made
of,
but
it&#39;s
2&quot;
long
by
1
1\\\\/16
wide
and
has
a
small
hole
at
the
top
for
hanging.
The
tiny
flowers
are
hand-painted
in
the
Russian
style
in
light
blue,
white,
and
green
on
the
black
surface
ON
BOTH
SIDES.
Beautiful!

SEA
FAIRY
-
Glass
Necklace
This
necklace
captures
the
sweetness
of
the
sea
fairy.
The
necklace
is
double
sided
giving
you
two
necklaces
for
the
price
of
one.
I
encapsulated
the
fairy
image
between
two
pieces
of
1
x
2
inch
crystal
clear
glass.
I
wanted
more
sparkle,
so
I
carefully
added
hair
thin
silver
wire
to
strategic
places
on
the
fairy
along
with
a
pearl
and
swarovski
crystal
dangle.
The
solder
on
this
necklace
is
lead
free.
The
necklace
hangs
from
a
sparkly,
transparent
blue
silk
18
inch
ribbon.
The
closure
is
a
lobster
claw
clasp
with
a
2
inch
extender.\r\n\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\r\n\r\n\r\nMost
of
my
beads
are
made
with
Moretti\\\\/Effetre,
Vetrofond,
Lauscha,
and
some
wonderful
new
reactive
glasses
produced
by
some
independent
glass
companies.
All
my
beads
are
annealed
in
a
digitally
controlled
kiln
for
durability
and
maximum
life.
Please
remember
the
beads
are
created
from
glass
and
must
be
treated
with
care.
They
are
not
for
children.

here
because
this
is
a

original!
This
case
opens
through
a
side

It
is
solid
metal
and
black.
It
is
lightweight
and
easy
to
carry
around.
Inside
the
case
is
enough
room
for
those
easy
to
lose
track
of
items
like
your

licencse,
student

This
is
a
great
little
item
to
carry
aroud
particularly
when
you&#39;re
out
and
about
and
only
need
the
essentials.
This

also
easily
holds
an

The

is
3

inches
wide
closed

is
protected
by
a
coating.
The
inside
of
the
case
has
two
spring
loaded
catches
to
keep
your
stuff
in
place!
This
makes
a
great
gift!
As
a
fan
of
watching
some
kick

I
decided
to
make
this
special
NEW

matter
for
a
design
will
not
get
a
lot
of
buyers,
but
I
really
want
to
show
my
support
for
this
awesome
sport
by
doing
a
few
new
designs!
This
design
includes
two
rumbling
roller
derby
girls!!
Acording
to
wikipedia....&quot;Nearly
all
contemporary
roller
derby
leagues
are
all-female
and
self-organized,
and
furthermore
were
formed
in
an
indie,
DIY
spirit
by
relatively
new
roller
derby
enthusiasts.
These
leagues
deploy
traditional
quad
roller
skates,
and
a
punk
aesthetic
and\\\\/or
ethic
is
often
prominent&quot;.
In
other
words,
this
sport
typifies
everything
about
powerful
females!

Notes
for
Non-US
&
Non-Canadian
Customers
Only:
\r\nPostal
rates
are
based
on
weight
and
the
prices
have
gone
up
considerably,
especially
for
overseas
shipping.
If
you
are
an
international
customer
(excluding
Candians
whose
items
will
ship
for
the
same
rate
as
Americans),
please
follow
the
shipping
rate
guidelines
above
if
you
are
only
buying
the
same
type
of
item
(i.e.
only
all
necklaces,
only
all
cigarette
cases,
etc).
If
you
want
to
buy
a
combination
of
items,
the
guidelines
above
still
apply
except
that
if
you
are
buying
a
cigarette
case,
each
necklace,
bracelet,
ring,
brooch,
or
pillbox
bought
in
addition
to
a
single
cigarette
case
is
$1.00
extra
shipping.
\r\n\r\nFor
example,
if
you
bought
two
cigarette
cases,
it
would
be
$9.00
for
the
two
cases
and
then
$1.00
extra
if
you
also
bought
a
necklace
with
the
two
cases.
For
example
again,
if
you
bought
one
cigarette
case,
it
would
be
$5.00
shipping
and
if
you
wanted
to
add
one
necklace
to
that,
it
would
be
an
extra
$1.00
shipping
to
do
so
for
a
total
of
$6.00.
For
example
again,
if
you
bought
one
cigarette
case,
it
would
be
$5.00
shipping
and
if
you
wanted
to
add
two
necklaces
to
that,
it
would
be
$2.00
extra
shipping
to
do
for
a
total
of
$7.00.
If
any
of
this
confuses
you,
because
I
know
it
confuses
me
even,
please
enquire
and
I
can
give
an
exact
quote.
\r\n\r\nPlease
inquire
about
specific
combined
shipping
costs
if
you
are
buying
more
than
3
cigarette
cases
and
are
a
non-USA,
non-Candian
customer,
because
I
may
be
able
to
provide
additional
discounts.

Will
Work
For
handmade
Clothes
assembled
art
framed
collage
recycled
magazine
paper
shopping
shopaholic
This
original
OOAK
collage
uses
a
wide
variety
of
color
and
patterns,
some
from
recycled
magazines,
some
from
a
scrapbooking
store,
and
some
from
my
sketchbook
(then
tinted
with
ink).
\r\n\r\nThis
piece
is
an
original,
not
a
print.
I
have
not
and
will
not
be
making
duplicates
or
prints,
to
keep
this
truly
unique.
\r\n\r\nFramed,
the
work
is
11
x
14
inches.
The
original
began
as
a
9
x
12
sketchbook
page,
and
expanded
from
there.
Sleek
black
frame
with
glass
are
included.
The
frame
may
be
hung
on
a
wall
or
displayed
on
a
table.
\r\n\r\nThe
theme
of
the
piece
was
nontraditional,
handmade
clothing.
A
closer
look
will
reveal
that
I
didn&#39;t
just
pop
these
lovely
ladies
out
of
a
magazine
as-is.
They&#39;ve
been
carefully
selected
and
hand
cut,
with
various
details
added
below
their
surfaces.
This
gives
their
outfits
something
interestingly
different
than
typical
clothes
in
a
catalog.
For
example,
the
blond
is
wearing
a
tank
shirt
which
has
been
reworked
with
a
purse
strap
in
place
of
its
original
strap.
They&#39;ve
been
cut
to
appear
as
thought
that&#39;s
how
the
shirt
was
designed.
\r\n\r\nMatted
on
olive
green
paper,
which
has
been
cut
and
hand-pieced
to
break
up
a
montonous
plain
background,
and
then
embellished
with
hand
stamped
flourish
designs
in
shades
of
blues
and
greens.
(Please
view
all
the
photos,
as
some
have
reflections
in
the
glass
from
items
around
the
room.)\r\n\r\nBackground
paper
was
specifically
chosen
to
provide
a
little
fun
for
the
back
of
the
frame
too,
which
is
made
of
a
clear
plexiglass
sheet
material.
Stand
this
frame
near
a
window
or
other
back-lighting
source,
and
you&#39;ll
see
an
extra
design
surprise
show
through
the
front!

Photo
The
Monarch
8x10
Photo\r\n\r\nThis
Photograph
is
entitled
&quot;The
Monarch&quot;.
This
Photograph
is
the
First
from
my
&quot;Butterfly&quot;
Series
which
consists
of
ten
strikingly
different
Original
Photographs
all
taken
of
the
Beautiful
and
Vibrantly
colored
Butterflies
that
I
may
come
across
using
my
trusty
Nikon
Camera.
I
am
lucky
enough
to
live
in
beautiful
and
sunny
San
Diego,
and
from
time
to
time
we
are
blessed
with
the
ability
to
find
butterflies
almost
anywhere.
Some
days
I
can
wake
up
to
numerous
butterflies
enjoying
my
backyard.
I
have
never
tried
to
shoot
one.
One
of
my
boys
saw
this
beautiful
Monarch
and
I
had
to
take
his
picture.
Each
Individual
Photograph
is
Limited
to
20
beautiful
prints.
Each
Photograph
will
be
individually
Numbered,
Signed
and

Green
Stick
Pearl
and
Silver
Earrings
\r\nThe
stick
pearls
in
this
pair
of
earrings
is
such
a
wonderful
color
and
almost
impossible
to
capture
on
film.
Shifting
from
green
to
pink
to
gold,
with
their
little
handmade
sterling
silver
hat,
these
earrings
are
very
special.\r\n\r\nThe
drop
is
just
a
tad
over
one
and
one
half
inches
long
and
hangs
from
a
simple
sterling
silver
French
hook.\r\n............................................................\r\nMetaphysical,
healing
and
symbolic
key
words
for
the
components
in
these
earrings:\r\n\r\nPearl:
the
stone
of
sincerity,
fidelity,
purity,
wisdom,
balance,
higher
truth,
Cancer,
Gemini,
the
number
7\r\n\r\nSilver:
a
precious
metal,
mildly
sedating
and
calming,
a
malleable
attractor,
retainer
and
director
of
energy,
enhances
the
power
of
the
Moon,
mirror
to
the
Soul,
catalyses
negative
energy
to
positive
energy,
cleanser,

&quot;Bald
Eagle&quot;
Fossil
ivory
scrimshaw\r\n\r\n\r\nThis
detailed
fossil
walrus
tooth
pendant
was
hand
engraved
with
a
special
engraving
tool
which
I
have
made
and
sharpened
to
the
finest
point.\r\n\r\nThis
makes
incredible
detail
possible!\r\n\r\n
\r\n\r\nThe
time
consuming
technique
I
used
involves
engraving
delicate
layers
of
overlapping
lines
to
gradually
create
the
image.
Some
stippling
is
also
used.\r\n\r\n
I
have
added
a
touch
of
subtle
color
to
this
piece.\r\n\r\n
Fossil
walrus
ivory
is
one
of
my
favorite
materials
to
engrave
for
many
reasons.
I
love
the
various
grains
and
colorations,
the
way
it
polishes
and
accepts
the
finest
detail!\r\n\r\nThe
back
of
the
piece
is
polished
-
signed
and
dated.\r\n\r\n
\r\n\r\nsize:
approx.
7\\\\/8&quot;
x
3\\\\/4&quot;
and
1\\\\/8&quot;
thick.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt
comes
on
an
18&quot;
sterling
silver
chain.\r\n\r\n
\r\nI
have
been
a
professional
artist
for
over
30
years,
the
first
eight
years
being
spent
as
a
scrimshaw
artist.\r\n\r\n
I
also
offer
limited
edition
etchings,
ACEOs
(art
trading
cards),
unique
jewelry,ornaments,
clocks
and
giclee
prints.
\r\n\r\nAs
time
allows
I
still
love
to
make
unique
one
of
a
kind
scrimshaw
pieces,
using
only
fossilized,
antique
ivory,
amber
or
mother
of
pearl.\r\n\r\n

healing
properties
of

is
associated
with
healing,
serenity,
calmness,
honesty
and
nobility.
Usually
found
off
the
coasts
of
S.
America,
Japan,
and
China.
Used
by
athletes
to
help
build
and
protect
muscle
tissue.
Also
benefits
the
heart
and
helps
in
digestion.
\r\n\r\nBlack
Obsidian\t\r\nA
powerful
and
creative
stone,
forces
us
to
face
up
to
our
true
self,
its
protective
and
dispels
negative
energy,
reduces
pain
of
Arthritis,
joints
and
cramps.
Formed
when
lava
is
quickly
cooled.
It
brings
purification,
transformation,
inner
growth,
fulfillment,
metamorphoses,
manifestation,
introspection,
practicality,
psychic
ability
and
the
correct
use
of
inner
power.
Absorbs
and
dissolves
anger,
criticism,
fear,
and
therefore
is
protective.
This
black
stone
absorbs
darkness
and
converts
it
to
white
light
energy.\r\n

Vintage
fabric
This
fabric
is
a
yummy
seafoam\\\\/turquoise
double
knit
that
I&#39;m
guessing
is
from
the
1970s.
It
is
62&quot;
wide
and
is
1
1\\\\/4
yards
long.
The
original
tag
that
is
still
attached
says
it
is
68%
polyester,
24%
acrylic
and
8%
rayon.
It
also
has
subtle
flecks
of
colors
woven
in
that
add
a
really
pretty
texture.
There
also
is
a
partial
label
that
was
pinned
to
it
that
I
have
left
intact.

TWENTY
VARITIES
OF
WINTER
HARDY
LAVENDER!\r\nLavenders
are
romantic,
beautiful
and
aromatic,
prized
for
there
easy
to
harvest
and
long
lasting
fresh
or
dried
flower
buds.
The
flowers
are
also
edible,
they
can
be
used
raw
in
salads,
added
to
soups
and
stews,
used
as
a
seasoning,
baked
into
cookies
and
brewed
into
tea.
Lavender
is
also
used
extensively
in
holistic
healing
with
antiseptic
and
anti-inflammatory
properties.
It
was
used
in
hospitals
during
WWI
to
disinfect
floors,
walls
and
other
surfaces.
An
infusion
of
lavender
is
claimed
to
soothe
and
heal
insect
bites.
Bunches
of
lavender
are
also
said
to
ward
off
insects.
If
applied
to
the
temples,
lavender
oil
is
said
to
soothe
headaches.
Lavender
is
frequently
used
as
an
aid
to
sleep
and
relaxation.
\r\nLavender
is
a
tough
plant
and
is
extremely
drought
resistant,
once
established,
hardy
to
zone
5.
However,
when
first
starting
your
lavender
plants,
they
demand
loose
composted
well
drained
soil.
They
also
do
well
in
a
container
as
long
as
the
root
system
is
not
allowed
to
sit
in
a
pool
of
water.
Lavender
plants
will
be
from
white,
pink,
light
lavender
to
dark
purple
blooms.
Plants
may
have
a
variegated
leaf
form
or
ghost
like
leaves.
All
are
promised
to
have
the
intoxicating
lavender
fragrance
to
use
for
crafting,
tasting,
healing
or
just
plan
gazing.\r\n\r\nTHEME

Origami
Star
Earrings
on
Sterling
Silver
Chain
with
Square
Garnets
These
bold
earrings
are
composed
of
one-of-a-kind
tiny
paper
stars
and
faceted
square
Garnet
beads
with
sterling
silver
chains,
wire
wraps,
and
ear
wires.
I
made
the
stars
out
of
pages
from
an
old
book
that
a
library
was
throwing
away,
so
each
star
is
unique,
and
the
book
paper
will
last
better
than
newsprint.
The
paper
may
yellow
a
bit
over
time,
but
I
think
it
only
enhances
their
look!
The
stars
have
been
protected
with
satin
finish
acrylic
varnish.
\r\n\r\nThe
earrings
are
about
2&quot;
(5.1cm)
long
from
the
tops
of
the
wires
to
the
bottom
of
the
stars.
The
stars
themselves
are
about
9/16&quot;
(1.5cm)
across
and
1/4&quot;
(.6cm)
thick.
\r\n\r\nGarnet
is
said
to
boost
confidence
and
self-esteem,
and
promote
success
in
business.
\r\n\r\nI
will
be
happy
to
include
a
free
pair
of
foamrubber
stoppers
for
the
backs
of
the
ear
wires
if
desired.\r\n\r\nCustom
work
is
also
available;

possible
styles,
or

MIDNIGHT
AND
NATURAL
CHERRY
SHAKER
BOXES
David
makes
his
Shaker
boxes
one
at
a
time
in
his
one
man
workshop.
He
patterns
them
after
those
at
the
Shaker
community
at
Sabbathday
Lake
Maine.
These
boxes
are
made
of
select
cherry
which
he
saws
into
thin
sheets
that
are
dimensioned
into
thickness,
length,
and
width.
He
then
cuts
and
bevels
the
graceful
swallowtails.
These
blanks
are
then
steamed,
shaped
around
molds,
and
secured
by
copper
tacks.
The
tops
and
bottoms
are
fastened
only
by
wood
pegs.
David
completes
them
with
several
hand
rubbed
finishes.
Shaker
boxes
have
become
symbolic
with
Shaker
life
and
work
and
are
valued
for
the
precision,
patience,
and
reverence
required
to
make
them.
Today
they
are
versatile
in
any
decor
with
unlimited
uses.\r\n\r\nSet

Kentucky
Wildcats
purse/tote
bag
handmade
You
are
looking
at
a
Kentucky
Wildcats
purse/tote
bag
made
of
a
cotton
fabric.\r\n\r\nThe
bottom,
lining
and
straps
are
made
of
a
solid
blue
cotton
fabric.
There
is
a
double
layer
of
fleece
batting
between
the
two
layers
of
the
bag
to
add
durability
to
the
product.
The
straps
are
lined
with
a
fusible
interfacing.\r\n\r\nThis
bag
is
trimmed
with
a
white
hairy
ostrich
feathery
gimp
trim.\r\n\r\nThis
bag
has
a
magnetic
snap
for
a
closure\r\n\r\nThe
bag
is
approximately
11
inches
wide
from
seam
to
seam
and
approximately
10
inches
tall.
The
handles
have
an
approximate
10
inch
drop
from
the
top
of
the
strap
to
the
top
of
the
bag
and
it
has
a
4
inch
bottom.\r\n\r\nAll
my
bags
are
handmade
by
me.

Girl&#39;s
Classic
Cream
Satin
Dress
size
3
to
4
This
dress
is
a
classic
design
made
for
melting
Grandparents
right
on
the
spot!
It&#39;s
made
of
the
softest
cream
color
satin
with
a
taffeta
underskirt
and
is
fully
lined.
\r\n\r\nI
made
this
dress
from
a
3T
pattern,
but
it
looks
like
it
might
fit
a
slightly
larger
girl.
The
bodice
measures
8.5&quot;
from
the
neckline
at
the
collar
seam
down
to
the
waist.
The
waistline
is
meant
to
hit
slightly
above
the
natural
waist
for
a
babydoll
effect.
From
the
same
place
on
the
shoulder
down
to
the
hem
the
dress
measures
22.5&quot;
total.\r\n\r\nThis
darling
dress
can
either
be
taken
to
the
dry
cleaner
or
washed
at
home
on
the
gentle
cycle
with
cold
water
and
dried
on
a
low
setting.
A
low
set
iron
can
also
be
used
as
needed.\r\n\r\nI
hope
this
dress
will
make
a
memorable
addition
to
your
celebrations.
:)\r\nAnna

Pisces
Pisces
is
a
water
sign
and
this
mystical
work
celebrates
the
12th
sign
of
the
zodiac!
\r\n\r\nThe
lining
is
an
abstract
watercolor
painting
in
blues,
purples
and
greens,
inside
a
round
tin
with
a
glass
top.
The
glyph
for
Pisces
is
on
the
inside
of
the
glass,
so
handling
won’t
smudge
it.
Also
on
the
inside
are
a
pewter
dolphin
charm
and
three
high
quality,
deep
purple
amethyst
stones,
associated
with
Pisces.
The
outside
is
wrapped
with
lavender
ribbon.
\r\n\r\nA
powerful
magnet
is
attached
to
the
back,
for
easy
display
on
your
refrigerator,
in
your
bedroom,
in
your
office
or
even
in
your
car.
It
also
makes
a
great
gift
for
the
Pisces
in
your
life.\r\n\r\nThe
piece
is
2”
(5.8
cm)
across
and
1”
(2.5)
deep.\r\n

original
art
card
Today
we
have
another
original
art
card
for
your
viewing
pleasure.
This
card
is
a
study
for
a
larger
painting
(as
yet
unpainted).
The
card
was
drawn
with
pencil
on
watercolor
paper.
It
features
a
little
man
with
a
big
head
getting
caught
doing
something
that
he
probably
shouldn&#39;t
be
doing.
Oops.\r\nThis
card
measures
the
standard
2
1\\\\/2&quot;
by
3
1\\\\/2&quot;
and
is
made
from
Arches
90
lb.
watercolor
paper.
It
is
signed
and
dated
on
the
back
and
comes
with
it&#39;s
own
little
protective
sleeve.
Oh,
and
yes,
this
is
an
original
card,
hand
drawn
by
me.
No
reproductions
here.
The
watermark
does
not
appear
on
the
actual
card
either.
Just
in
case
you
were
worried.\r\n\r\nThanks
for
stopping
by!

Just
Peachy
Linen
Apron
-
Hand
dyed
Beautiful
vintage
linen
that
has
been
hand-dyed
and
redesigned.
\r\n\r\nIn
it&#39;s
former
life
this
beautiful
ruffled
apron
served
as
an
elegant
linen
tablecloth.
It
was
a
bit
tired
looking
by
the
time
I
found
it
in
a
vintage
shop
in
Port
Townsend.
I
brought
it
home,
cleaned
it
up
and
infused
some
color
for
a
fresh
look.
Then
I
got
out
the
scissors...\r\n\r\nFeminine
look
with
lots
of
character.\r\n\r\nWould
make
a
unique
gift.\r\n\r\nMachine
wash
gentle/dry
lo/press
as
needed.\r\nDye
has
been
heat
set,
but
I
always
recommend
washing
separate
for
a
hand-dyed
piece.
\r\n\r\nThis
apron
was
crafted
using
high
quality
recycled
linen.\r\n\r\n

Rainbow

Skinny
Scarf
Tie
Dye
Look
Lariat
Can
a
color
be
both
pastel
and
bright
at
the
same
time?
This
lovely
rainbow-colored
skinny
scarf
is
soft
pastel,
but
has
a
cheerful
vibrancy,
too,
a
bit
like
tie-dye.\r\n\r\nA
mosaic
of
colors...
blues,
golds,
greens,
and
rosy
pinks,
with
a
mixture
of
textures
and
a
bit
of
shimmer.\r\n\r\nLariat
style
scarf
measures
approx.
90&quot;(229cm)
long
and
1.5&quot;(3.8cm)
wide,
including
fringed
ends.\r\n\r\nSkinny
scarves
look
great
worn
long
and
loose
or
wrapped
several
times
for
a
cowl
style.
A
soft,
lightweight
way
to
add
an
awesome
pop
of
color
to
any
outfit...more
than
just
a
scarf...call
it
&quot;fiber
jewelry&quot;.\r\n\r\nKnit
from
a
yarn
that
is
bulky,
yet
light
and
soft...a
blend
of
36%
nylon,
35%
wool,
18%
acrylic,
and
11%
cotton.
\r\n\r\nPlease
hand
wash
cold
and
dry
flat.

RAE

Limited
Edition
ACEO
print
-

This
kindly
lady
Mandarin
Duck
is
giving
tiny
Rae
a
lift
across
the
river.
\r\n\r\nOne
of
only
30
of
it&#39;s
kind.
The
original
was
sold
a
little
while
back,
but
I
love
how
these
little
prints
are
turning
out!\r\n\r\nRae
is
printed
onto
glossy
paper
to
bring
out
her
colours
and
mounted
onto
a
gorgeous,
slightly
sparkley,
pure
white
card,
so
she
has
a
tiny
border
around
if
you
wish
to
frame
her.
She
is
also
signed,
numbered
and
dated
on
the
reverse.\r\n\r\nI
have
slightly
degraded
the
photos
here
on
the
listing,
but
your
ACEO
will
arrive
wonderfully
clear
and
crisp!
The
second
picture
shows
the
dimensions
of
the
ACEO.\r\n\r\nMeasurements:
ACEOs
always
measure
2.5&quot;

tiny,
affordable

collectible!\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks

They

I
had
to

to
make
them
myself
because
my
Aunt
was
the
only
other
one
I
knew
that
would
make
them
and
I
always
wanted
hers.
She
is
so

I
usually
got

too!

Chalcedony
Flat
Pear
Beads
-
12mm
(A206)
These
chalcedony
pear
beads
are
smooth,
not
faceted,
and
they
are
thicker
than
most
flat
pear
beads.
They
are
almost
a
nugget
shape,
except
that
they
are
very
regular.
Chalcedony
is
a
form
of
silica
composed
of
very
fine
intergrowths
of
the
minerals
quartz
and
moganite.

Sorority
Tshirt
Recycled
into
size
Medium
Retro
Style
Pencil
Skirt
Every
one
of
my
unique
T-shirt
skirts
is
totally
one
of
a
kind.
This
skirt
will
really
make
heads
turn.
It
is
constructed
entirely
of
a
cotton
T-shirt
which
makes
this
skirt
as
comfy
as
a
t-shirt
and
easy
to
launder
just
throw
in
the
washer
and
dryer.
The
pencil
style
is
very
flattering
and
sexy.
The
drawstring
waist
allows
you
to
wear
the
skirt
anywhere
from
waist
to
lower
on
your
hips.
The
stretchy
t-shirt
jersey
material
really
gives
to
allow
comfort
in
your
waist,
butt,
and
hips-
where
ever
you
need
a
li’l
extra
space.
\r\nWaist
size
30”
(76cm)
on
drawstring
and
length
24”
(61cm)\r\n\r\n\r\nWhy
Buy
Trashion?\r\nTrashion
is
one
of
the
fashion
world’s
most
underground
but
exploding
trends.
Using
what
others
have
discarded
to
create
amazing
new
art
pieces
and
apparel
is
a
way
to
promote
recycling
as
well
as
beating
quick
fads
in
fashion.
By
wearing
upcycled
garments
you
are
taking
part
in
promoting
a
green
trend.
Hopefully
others
will
want
to
participate
in
what
you
are
demonstrating
simply
by
looking
so
cool
in
your
new
old
clothes.
In
addition
to
promoting
recycling
and
green
thinking,
trashion
is
a
way
to
stand
up
against
big
business
and
factory
human
rights
violations
around
the
world.
American
independent
fashion
designers
have
a
tough
job
competing
with
prices
of
clothing
made
in
Asia
and
Central
America.
The
cost
of
fabric
in
America
is
usually
more
than
the
cost
of
a
garment
already
made
and
ready
for
sale.
In
addition,
that
bought
fabric
was
probably
made
at
those
same
factories
that
we
are
embarrassed
to
support.
Trashion
allows
us
to
really
give
them
a
run
for
their
money.
Since
vintage
clothing
and
materials
are
cheap
and
widely
available
it
is
a
great
source
of
relatively
cheap
materials
allowing
us
to
put
more
paid
time
into
its
artistic
construction.
Consider
all
the
oil
saved
when
vintage
fabrics
are
used
instead
of
new
ones
shipped
in
from
all
over
the
world.
Think
of
all
the
landfill
space
that
can
be
saved
by
reusing
materials.
Imagine
how
many
less
natural
resources
are
consumed
by
not
having
to
make
another
yard
of
fabric.
Another
benefit
of
trashion
is
that
the
materials
are
just
so
awesome.
Vintage
fabrics
can
often
offer
more
than
their
fabric
store
competition.
Often
times,
great
vintage
patterns
or
graphics
allow
for
one
of
a
kind
pieces
to
take
shape.
Vintage
fabrics
can
also
provide
superior
qualities
of
that
particular
type
of
fabric.
For
instance
a
wool
sweater
re-worked
into
a
funky
pair
of
legwarmers
may
provide
a
customer
more
quality
for
their
money
since
the
price
of
the
wool
from
the
fabric
store
could
run
more
than
the
retail
price
of
those
upcycled
funky
new
legwarmers.
Recycled
fabrics
often
have
been
washed
many
times
and
are
therefore
unlikely
to
shrink
or
fade-
since
they
probably
already
did.
Lastly,
and
perhaps
most
cool,
is
that
trashion
pieces
are
often
one
of
a
kind
fashion
art
that
could
truly
never
be
replicated.
When
you
buy
trashion
pieces
you
are
supporting
a
lot
of
great
causes
and
concepts
including
a
greener
planet,
more
independent
designers,
not
participating
in
human
rights
violations,
as
well
as
great
original
pieces
made
from
fabulous
fabrics.
Make
the
world
a
better
place
and
buy
trashion.
You’ll
be
glad
you
did!

TROPICAL
HIBISCUS
The
tropical
hibiscus
belongs
to
the
Malvaceae
or
mallow
family.
Other
relatives
are
the
rose-of-sharon,
the
hardy
hibiscus
grown
in
the
north,
okra,
cotton,
the
Confederate
Rose,
holly
hock
and
quite
a
few
others.
\r\n\r\nOriginating
in
Asia
and
the
Pacific
islands,
Hibiscus
rosa-sinensis
is
the
national
flower
of
Malaysia.
It
is
closely
associated
with
Hawaii,
however,
the
state
flower
for
Hawaii
is
a
native
species
of
hibiscus.
Thousands
of
colors
(no
true
blue
or
black),
some
varieties
have
blossoms
2”
in
diameter
and
others
10-12”..There
are
some
with
bushes
that
will
only
grow
a
foot
in
several
years
while
others
may
grow
to
15
feet
if
left
undisturbed.
Singles,
doubles,
some
blooming
almost
every
day,
the
variation
in
the
tropical
hibiscus
family
is
astounding!\r\n\r\nWe
believe
the
Hibiscus
the
Peony,
and
the
Iris
flower
pictures
make
an
outstanding
floral
decoration
for
any
home.
\r\n\r\nThis
cross
stitch
original
work
was
done
by
a
highly
skilled
needlework
professional
who,
for
10
years,
owned
and
operated
a
Craft
Shop
in
Baltimore
that
featured
cross
stitch
items.
She
acquired
her
outstanding
cross
stitch
skills
by
working
and
studying
with
highly
acclaimed
professionals
for
several
years.\r\n\r\nThe
original
work
was
done
in
14
count
aida
cloth
with
DMC
Floss.
The
picture
itself,
measures
7
X
10
inches,
and
is
presented
ready
for
framing
in
a
double
16
X
12
inch
mat
with
white
cardboard
backing.
The
primary
mat
is
white
and
the
secondary
mat
is
textured
black.\r\n\r\nFor
best
results
we
recommend
a
frame
with
non-glare
glass.\r\n

BABYS
FIRST
HAIRCUT
KEEPSAKE
CERTIFICATE
pink
or
blue
or
lemon
and
mint
certificates
available
Originally
tradition
had
it
that
the
first
cut
piece
of
hair
was
taken
and
hidden
away
to
protect
the
child
and
to
bid
them
well
for
the
rest
of
their
lives.
Today
however,
many
people
do
this
out
of
sentimentality
so
this
certificate
is
the
perfect
way
to
record
this
special
event.\r\n\r\nThis
delightfully
decorated
card
certificate
measures
approximately
15cm
x
24cm.
This
certificate
is
perfect
for
keeping
that
first
cut
little
lock
of
hair
safe
and
sound.
It
has
spaces
to
add
the
baby&#39;s
name,
the
date,
the
name
of
the
hair
salon
and
the
name
of
the
hairdresser
as
a
special
reminder
for
in
years
to
come.
On
the
back
there
is
an
explanation
of
the
tradition
of
keeping
that
first
lock.
A
lovely
gift
for
a
new
baby
or
a
christening.
Available
in
pink,
blue
or
lemon
and
mint.
\r\n\r\nThis
item
may
be
personalised
for
an
additional
£1.00
for
up
to
9
letters.
The
baby&#39;s
name
will
be
added
to
the
outside
of
the
keepsake
box.
\r\n\r\nThe
certificate
comes
protectively
wrapped
by
mulberry
paper
in
a
matching
decorated
card
box.
An
example
of
a
similar
box
can
be
seen
in
the
photographs
of
the
&quot;My
Christening
Day&quot;
Keepsake
Cards
that
are
also
listed
in
my
shop.\r\n\r\nThis
item
is
my
own
design
and
is
a
unique
keepsake.

Marvelous
Mosaic
Bust
One
of
the
most
labor
intensive
pieces
to
date
for
me.
This
bust
stands
23&quot;
tall
and
is
about
15&quot;
at
the
widest
(shoulders).
The
more
you
look
at
it
the
more
treasured
you
find
imbedded
between
glittering
stained
glass
and
mirror
glass
of
all
colors,
colored
gems,
millifiore,
glass
beads,
rhinestones,
etc.
The
grey
grout
makes
everything
&#39;pop&#39;.\r\n\r\nShe
can
stand,
or
be
hung
(wire
attached
to
back),
the
back
is
open,
so
cannot
be
viewed
360º.
\r\n\r\nEnjoy!
thanks
for
looking.

and
the
designs
of
Erte.
Emma
is
a
fun
bunny
reminding
you
of
the
lost
boys
from
Peter
Pan,
with
an
expressive
face
and
cuddly
shape.
Emma
is
created
from
100%
cotton
fabrics
sourced
from
new
and
vintage
sources
and
finished
with
a
variety
of
embroidery,
applique,
buttons
and
yoyos.
She
is
35cm
tall
and
22cm
wide.
She
can
be
cleaned
by
either
a
sponge
off
or
gentle
hand
wash.
For
children
under
three
I
recommend
removing
any
buttons.

Multistrand
Necklace
With
Lantern
Shaped
Dangle
I
really
like
this
one.
The
necklace
part
consists
of
three
strands
-
One
is
blue
seed
beads,
one
is
pink
seed
beads
and
the
other
is
liquid
silver.
The
only
way
I
can
think
of
to
describe
the
large
bead
on
the
dangle
is
to
call
it
lantern
shaped.
It
is
six
sided
and
metal,
and
each
side
has
a
flower
enameled
design
on
it.
Below
that
are
three
small
dangles
of
blue
seed
beads
with
round
garnets
at
the
bottom.
The
length
of
the
necklaceis
19
1\\\\/2&quot;,
not
including
the
clasp
or
the
dangle.
The
dangle
measures
2
1\\\\/4&quot;.

Needle
felted
Pink
Poodle
Necklace
A
fun
little
felted
piece
to
wear.
This
little
pink
poodle
is
on
an
18
inch,
silver,
smooth
necklace
chain.
\r\n
I
used
a
bight
pink
for
the
basic
parts
of
the
poodle,
and
added
a
mix
of
cream
and
pink
to
accent
certain
areas,
such
as
her
top
knot,
her
throat
area,
and
around
her
eye
area.
\r\n
She
has
a
tiny
green
with
pink
polka
dot
bow
in
her
ear.
\r\n
The
poodle
is
2x2
inches,
she
has
a
black
bead
eye.

I
have
a

retro

I
have
been
busy
making
a
whole
range
of
new
products
for
etsy
and
these
are
the
first
I
am
listing
-
unique,
charming
patchwork
pictures,
all
hand-sewn
and
designed
by
Rosie&#39;s
Retro
Styling,
with
components
sourced
from
the
USA
and
the
UK.\r\n\r\nThis
picture
measures
7.5&quot;
by
5.5&quot;
and
is
made
from
9
different
fabric
pieces,
some
American
feedsack
and
some
more
contemporary
pieces
-
all
cotton
-
that
are
coloured
pinks,
reds,
purples
and
greens
-
with
a
floral
theme.
They
are
sewn
onto
recycled
paper,
made
from
cotton,
so
there
is
a
lovely
textured
effect.\r\n\r\nThe
frame
is
unpainted
pine
and
has
glass
insert,
it
can
be
used
as
a
stand-up
picture
frame
or
hung
on
the
wall.\r\n\r\nI
have
used
vintage
American
dark
green
cotton
sewing
thread
to
piece
all
the
fabrics,
there
are
parallel
two
lines
of
running
stitches
right
round
and
securing
all
the
other
pieces.
My
own
make
label
at
the
bottom
shows
this
is
from
Rosie&#39;s
Retro
Styling
and
is
a
total
one-off.\r\n\r\nThis
is
ideal
for
any
room
in
the
house
where
you
want
a
shabby
chic
and
vintage
with
a
twist
!
Check
out
all
the
other
patchworks
and
make
it
a
set.

CLEARANCE
This
polymer
clay
pendant
is
one
of
a
kind
and
comfortable
to
wear.
The
pendant
is
just
over
2.5&quot;
long,
and
just
over
1.5&quot;
across.\r\n\r\nIt
could
double
as
a
tree
ornament
or
key
fob.
Though
it
isn&#39;t
designed
for
the
type
of
wear
and
tear
a
daily
use
key
chain
would
subject
it
to,
it
would
be
nice
for
a
special
key
that
needs
something
colorful
to
distinguish
it.\r\n\r\nCLEARANCE:
Was
$7.00,
Now
$1.00!\r\n\r\n

Black
Tie
for
Dad
This
is
a
custom
hand
made
authentic
Bullet
Bolo
Tie
made
from
two
.223
Remington
(also
known
as
military
5.56mm)
cartridges
joined
together.\r\n\r\nThere
is
no
powder
or
live
primers.\r\n\r\nThe
tie
is
black
military
issue
parachute
cord
and
is
tipped
with
two
5.56mm
military
Full
Metal
Jacket
(FMJ)
bullets.\r\n\r\nAs
our
Bolo
Ties
are
individually
hand
crafted,
each
one
is
unique
and
subtly
different
in
design
and
dimension.\r\n\r\nOverall
length
(open
end
to
end)
is
approx
35&quot;
(folded
17
1\\\\/2&quot;).\r\n\r\nWeighs
approx
0.7
oz.\r\n\r\nDue
to
the
varying
quality
of
brass
cases
by
each
manufacturer,
both
new
and
used,
each
bolo
tie
may
also
be
distinct
due
to
any
minor
marks,
scratches,
dings
and\\\\/or
other
blemishes
on
the
cases.\r\n\r\nA
great
idea
for
a
unique
gift,
presentation
or
to
purchase
for
your
own
enjoyment.
A
real
hit
at
those
military
reunions,
shooting
competitions,

cowboy
themed
events

The
“A4-A3”
family
is
my
pride!
I
got
the
concept
of
those
bags
many
years
ago,
being
an
undergraduate
and
having
to
carry
A3
projects
and
paper
rolls
of
sketches.
I
used
to
take
huge
handbags
with
me
and
return
home
with
an
empty
“giant”!
Ever
since
an
“A4-A3”
has
become
my
shoulder’s
extension!!
\r\n\r\nIf
you
are
a
baby’s
mother
or
a
weekend
traveler,
a
designer
or
an
architect,
an
officer
or
just
someone
who
desires
an
alternative
bag,
I
suggest
you
to
try
one
of
the
“A4-A3”
s.\r\n\r\nEach
bag
from
this
family
is
unique
and
special.
The
only
common
thing
is
the
concept
of
becoming
double
in
size
and
that
they
have
been
created
with
love
for
everyone
who
needs
them.
I
hope
you
will
love
them,
too.\r\n\r\n-\tOutside:

votives
fit
most
standard

votive

Please
keep
your
wicks
trimmed
for
maximum
burn
time
from
your
candles
as
well
as
candle
safety.\r\n\r\nBlack
Mountain
Candles
burn
very
cleanly
and
evenly
with
NO
wasted
wax.\r\nI
use
only

only
the
BEST
ingredients
for

throw
and
candle
performance.\r\n\r\nJust
one
of
these
can
easily
fragrance
your
entire
house!
Fragrance
oil
is
the
most
expensive
part
of
the
candle
and
unlike
many
candlemaker&#39;s,
I
am
very
liberal
with
the
fragrance
oil
I
add
to
each
candle.
\r\nThis
allows
me
to
provide
a
candle
that
not
only
burns
great
but
smells
great
too.\r\n\r\nBlack
Mountain
Candles
are
made
from
soy,
a
RENEWABLE
resource.
Buying
soy
candles
not
only
brings
you
a
cleaner,
healthier
candle
but
helps
to
support
the
American
farming
industry
as
well.\r\nEach
one
is
individually
handmade
with
loving
hands
and
attention
to
detail
and
alot
of
love
and
pride!

These
large

jasper
remind
me
of

one

1\\\\/2

circumference,and
they
are

with
two

They
dangle
down

Green,

and
Blue
Wire
Wrapped
Lampwork
Bracelet
This
bracelet
was
made
using
lampwork
beads
that
I
made
in
my
home
studio.
The
colors
are
lime
green,
orange
and
blue.\r\nThey
were
made
with
Italian
art
glass
and
were
annealed
in
a
digitally
controlled
kiln
to
provide
strength
and
longevity.\r\n\r\nOnly
the
best
materials
were
used
including
20
gauge
sterling
silver
wire
to
wrap
each
bead
as
it&#39;s
own
secure
link
and
to
create
little
dangley
crystal
charms.
Sterling
silver
accent
beads,
Swarovski
crystals,
a
sterling
silver
heart
clasp
and
a
sterling
silver
heart
charm
were
also
used.\r\n\r\nLength
when
clasped
adjusts
from
7
1\\\\/4&quot;
to
8
1\\\\/2&quot;.\r\n\r\nThe
bracelet
will
arrive
in
an
organza
pouch
ready
to
give
as
a
gift
or
enjoy
for
yourself.

Green
Apple
and
Chamomile
Sugar
Scrub
This
scrub
is
crisp,
green
and
refreshing.
It&#39;s
a
perfect
way
to
wake
up
and
get
you
going.\r\n\r\nOur
sugar
scrubs
are
made
with
the
finest
ingredients
available.
We
use
organic
vanilla
infused
cane
sugar.
We
primarily
use
almond
oil
or
grapeseed
oil
in
most
scrubs
and
always
use
aloe
vera
gel.
\r\n\r\nSugar
Scrubs
are
great
used
daily
but
we
recommend
weekly.
You
don&#39;t
want
to
over
exfoliate!
We
recommend
doing
a
test
spot
on
your
skin
to
find
out
how
your
skin
reacts.
\r\n\r\nScrubs
are
a
wonderful
body
polisher
leaving
your
skin
refreshed
and
glowing.

Necklace
Handmade
Two
Tone
Turquoise
Blue
with
Swarovski
Crystals
in
Sterling
Silver
Two
shades
of
pretty
light
blue
turquoise
make
this
a
bright
splash
of
color!
The
6
mm
rounds
are
slightly
darker
than
the
bright
blue
cones
that
create
the
framing
in
the
front.
In
between
are
dazzling
6mm
bicones
of
flashy
Aurora
Borealis
Swarovski
Crystals
hugging
pretty
dotted
Bali
Sterling
Silver
spacer
beads.
The
effect
is
a
stunning
visual
of
sparkle
and
two
tone
BLUE.
This
necklace
commands
attention
so
it
is
not
for
the
shy
people
out
there
:)\r\n\r\nNecklace
is
19
3/8
inches
(48.45
cm)
in
length
and
is
finished
with
a
Sterling
Silver
lobster
clasp
and
a
soldered
shut
Sterling
jump
ring.
It
can
be
shortened
or
lengthened
as
desired
but
this
is
a
good
length
for
framing
most
peoples&#39;
faces
while
still
being
long
enough
to
not
be
a
choker.
It
will
be
mailed
in
a
gift
box
for
safekeeping
so
it
will
be
ready
to
keep
or
give
as
a
gift.\r\n\r\nJust
a
fun
to
wear
necklace
in
popular
Turquoise
colors.\r\n\r\nThanks
for
visiting
my
shop!\r\n\r\n(Both
of
the
stone
sets
are
called
Turquoise.
One
is
dyed
howlite
and
the
other
is
a
reconstituted
Turquoise.
They
are
lovely
and
*real*
but
a
bit
enhanced,

are

Dog
Sweater
Size
small.Spring
colors
Handmade
in
New
Hampshire
USA\r\n\r\nThis
sweater
is
made
of
acrylic
yarn
and
fun
fur.
I
would
consider
this
a
Spring
sweater.
The
main
color
is
royal
blue
with
a
strand
of
multicolored
fun
fur
running
through
the
body
of
the
sweater,
There
are
holes
for
the
front
legs
to
come
through.The
sweater
is
7
inches
long.
I
have
made
these
kinds
of
sweaters
for
adult
chihuahua&#39;s
and
this
sweater
should
fit
that
size
dog.
All
my
sweaters
are
one
of
a
kind
and
I
use
my
own
patterns.
I
may
use
the
same
patterns
but
never
the
same
color
schemes.
Your
pup
will
be
the
only
one
with
this
sweater.

made
from
purple
glass
beads
with
white

them
a
lot
of
depth),
clear

Knit
Pattern
for
an
Upright
Elephant
This
pattern
is
for
a
knit
elephant.
It
is
made
from
4
ply
cotton
and
is
about
10
inches
tall.
Size
8
needles
were
used.
Pattern
is
5
pages
long,
with
easy
to
follow,
step
by
step
illustrated
instructions.
(You
can
also
email
me
if
you
need
help.)
\r\n\r\nElephant
is
made
without
a
lot
of
intricate
shaping,
so
he&#39;s
a
good
project
even
for
a
beginning
knitter.
He
wears
a
colorful
knit
necktie
and
he&#39;s
very
cuddly!
\r\n\r\nThis
pattern
will
be
emailed
to
you
as
a
pdf
file.
\r\n\r\nPattern
is
copyrighted
by
me,
so
it
cannot
be
copied
and
resold
or
distributed
in
any
manner.
However,
I
don’t
mind
if
you
make
the
finished
knit
item
and
sell
them.

Original
Collage
Under
Glass
Plate-
Unspoken
This
is
a
reverse
decoupage
piece.
These
dream-like
images
come
from
many
hours
of
reflection.
The
deep
red
flowers
beginning
to
flow
down
the
top
of
her
head
depicts
her
passionate,
uninhibited,
emotional
side,
battling
with
the
words
she
can&#39;t
quite
use
too
express
her
intense
feelings.
She
is
stumbling
to
get
the
words
right,
unsure
of
how
much
to
reveal,
how
much
will
be
accepted.
The
points
toward
her
eyes
remind
us
that
this
is
where
the
spirit
comes
from,
which
can
never
be
silenced
or
judged.
Make
what
you
will
of
this,
as
with
most
things
in
life,
there
is
no
definite
interpretation.\r\n\r\nThe
glass
plate
measures
8&quot;
round.
It
is
a
one
of
a
kind
piece
and
is
signed
by
me
,
Cara
Elizabeth.
The
back
of
the
piece
is
finished
with
gold
leaf
and
sealed
for
protection.\r\nThe
plate
is
food
safe
but
cannot
be
submerged
in
water.
Please
just
wipe
with
a
clean
cloth.\r\n\r\nThanks
for
looking
and
hope
you
enjoy!

Mola
Textile
26,
Cross-
Native
Kuna
Indian
Reverse
Applique
Dimensions:
17.5&quot;x
13&quot;\r\nMetric:
44
x
33
cm\r\n\r\nThe
Kuna
Indians
of
the
San
Blas
Islands
make
exquisite
textiles
like
this
one,
called
a
mola.
The
panels
are
used
to
decorate
their
blouses,
normally
one
in
the
front
and
one
in
back.
They
were
originally
inspired
by
traditional
motifs
from
their
body
art
and
Kuna
legend,
but
later
went
on
to
incorporate
images
from
daily
life,
including
the
mass
media.\r\n\r\nThe
Kuna
are
found
in
Panama
and
Colombia.
The
women
continue
to
wear
molas
and
being
skilled
in
the
craft
is
honored
among
them.
It
has
also
become
an
important
source
of
income
for
them
through
tourism
and
collectors.
There
are
many
&quot;factories&quot;
that
imitate
molas
and
cater
only
to
tourism.
My
supplier
lived
in
Panama
for
17
years
and
has
a
mola
addiction.\r\n\r\nThe
technique
is
exquisite
and
the
color
choices
are
often
pretty
wild.
Molas
are
made
by
combining
cut-work
or
reverse
appliqué
and
regular
appliqué.
Reverse
appliqué
is
the
process
of
cutting
into
a
background
fabric
to
expose
that
color
of
fabric,
while
the
best
known
form
of
appliqué
adds
fabric
to
the
top
of
another
piece
for
contrast.
The
Kuna
use
both,
cutting
back
and
adding
on
top.
They
accent
the
design
with
embroidery.\r\n\r\nA
mola
appreciates
in
value
depending
on
how
old
it
is,
if
it
was
used
by
a
Kuna
woman,
how
tiny
the
stitches
are,
how
many
layers
of
fabric
were
used
for
cut-work,
and
for
the
overall
design
of
the
piece.
Similar
techniques
are
used
in
traditional
Hawaiian
quilts,
by
the
Sindhi
people
in
Pakistan,
by
the
Hmong
in
Thailand
and
around
the
world.
But,
each
culture
has
translated
the
technique
uniquely
and
the
Kuna
are
undoubtedly
the
most
psychedelic
of
them
all!\r\n\r\nThese
panels
can
be
framed
as
they
are
or
incorporated
into
other
projects
(t-shirts,
jean
jackets,
pillows,
purses,
quilts).
One
of
the
photos
shows
the
back
so
that
you
can
see
some
of
the
stitching.\r\n\r\nPlease
visit
my
store
for
many
more
gorgeous
ethnic
textiles
and
for
things
that
I
make,
too.
I
combine
shipping
on
multiple

worldwide,

strive
to
support
hand
made
textiles
from
many
cultures.

Windy
When
does
&quot;breezy&quot;
become
&quot;windy&quot;?
When
you
have
to
turn
your
face
away
from
it.\r\n\r\nThe
original
is
color
brush
pens
on
bristol
board.\r\n\r\nThe
art
image
is
8.5
inch
x
11
inch.\r\n\r\nThe
print
is
packed
into
a
clear
plastic
sleeve
with
a
light
blue
card
stock
backing
and
a
nifty
little
corner
label
featuring
the
prints
name.\r\n\r\nMy
prints
are
done
on
a
very
high
quality
ink
jet
printer
and
scanned
from
the
original
art
with
my
super
awesome
new
great
scanner
that
captures
so
much
detail
it&#39;s
almost
criminal.
All
scanning
and
printing
is
done
by
myself
and
painstakingly
adjusted
and
mastered
until
I
am
happy
with
the
results.
The
prints
are
all
made
on
Epson
Premium
Presentation
Paper,
which
is
a
44
pound
ink
jet
card
stock
paper
that
provides
a
very
flat
matte
finish
and
crisp
colors.
My
art
is
almost
all
done
with
a
specific
kind
of
acrylic
paints
that
dry
to
a
very
flat
matte
finish,
or
with
ink
on
paper
or
bristol
board.
I
much
prefer
a
matte
finish
in
my
art
and
work
towards
that
aim
with
my
materials
and
techniques
(no
gloss
varnish
for
me!),
and
my
prints
represent
that
as
well.
This
paper
captures
that
look
perfectly.

Rivet
Headband
When
I
first
tied
the
knot
on
this
cute
little
linen
and
polka-dot
headband
I
was
reminded
of
Rosie
the
Riveter
and
her
perky
kerchief—not
to
mention
her
&quot;can-do&quot;
attitude.
\r\nThis
simple,
sleek,
reversible
headband
is
named
in
honor
of
her.
\r\nPlus,
people
will
be
riveted
by
it
when
you
wear
it!\r\n\r\nIf
you&#39;re
feeling
mellow
you
can
wear
it
with
the
linen
side
up
and
just
a
hint
of
color
showing.
If
you&#39;re
feeling
peppy
you
can
wear
it
with
the
polka-dots
out.The
headband
measures
approximately
17&quot;
long
and
is
3&quot;
at
its
widest
point.A
thin
piece
of
black
elastic
holds
the
ends
together
and
keeps
it
snug
around
your
head.\r\n\r\nThanks
for
looking!

4
years
ago
at
my
NYM
Arts
Studio
here
in
New
York
specifically
to
rescue
YOUR
old
lamp
bases.
I
design
every

you
see
in

I
make
every
shade
by
hand.
My
fabrication
technique
is
totally
unique
-
The

Curved

Panels
is
My
Unique
Contribution
to
Lighting
History,
and
gives
me
the
Honor
of
being
THE
ONLY
Mica
Shade
Artist
in
America
Today.
I
work
in
3
kinds
of
Amber
Mica
(Dark
Mottled
Amber,
Light
Amber
&
Natural
Amber
(with
Black
Flecks)
,
and
Silver
Mica,
usually
with
an

design.
Please
be
mindful
of
the
considerable
amount
of
time
and
physical
pain
endured
(bent
panel
shades)
to
bring
this
finished
piece
to
you.
My
Collectible

are
indeed
rare.
One
of
my

can
now
be
seen

-
shabby

recycled
glass
jar
filled
with
lily
of
the

crystals
-
a
perfect
gift
to
give
This
is
a
one
of
a
kind
recycled
glass
jar
with
a
toile
image
from
a
section
of
luxe
wallpaper
sealed
over
a
distressed
sage
green
finish.
The
lid
has
been
sealed
with
decoupage
(fully
cured).
I
also
added
a
strand
or
pretty
white
tulle
around
the
jar&#39;s
rim.
It&#39;s
filled
w\\\\/lily
of
the
valley
bath
crystals.
This
little
beauty
is
3.75&quot;
tall
and
3.25&quot;
wide.
It
would
make
a
wonderful
gift
or
a
great
treat
for
yourself.
Recycled
jars
look
really
nice
as
bathroom
accents
and\\\\/or
on
a
vanity
or
dresser.
When
you
use
up
all
the
crystals,
it&#39;s
also
perfect
for
storage.\r\n\r\nI
purchased
the
bath
crystals
from
a
fellow
etsy
member
who
hand
scented
them
herself
(thefragrancelady.etsy.com).\r\n\r\nPlease

Pointer
by

Alexander

like
your

picture!\r\n\r\nThis
is
a
relief
tile
(tile
is
not
flat).
It&#39;s
a
3-D
ceramic
portrait,
so
the
nose
of
the
dog
sticks
out
to
3\\\\/4&quot;
and
the
edge
is
3\\\\/16&quot;
deep.
\r\n\r\nAll
tiles
are
made

marking

your
dog)

individually
handpainted.
Small
variations
may
occur.
Please
allow

is
not
your
ordinary
tile.
It
is
finely
carved
out
of
clay
to
show
off
the
hair
texture
and
finest
detail.
Then
the
glaze
is
applied
by
hand
that
brings
the
dog
to
life!
And
it&#39;s
all
done
by
Sondra
Alexander\r\n\r\n\r\nYou

6&quot;
handmade
ceramic
tile.
They
are
all
hand
signed
by
the
artist
on
the
back
of
the
tile.
A
metal
hook
is
fired
into
the
back
of
the
tile
which
makes
it
easy
to
hang
on
a
picture
hook
or
a
plate
stand.
Tiles
are
also
perfect
for
that
special
back
splash
in
your
bath
or
kitchen.
(Please
order
tile
WITHOUT
hook
if
it
is
going
to
be
installed
on
a
wall.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThese
tiles
are
a
perfect
gift
idea
or
a
memorial!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHere
are
a
few
words
from
her
collectors!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n&quot;Sondra&#39;s
tiles
are
very
unique
one
of
a
kind
pieces
of
art.
What
better
way
to
immortalize
your
pet.
I
also
have
given
these
as
gifts
to
my
friends
and
celebrity
talent.&quot;\r\n\r\n-
Christopher
Ameruoso
(Editor
in
Chief
of
PAW
print
magazine)\r\n\r\n\r\n&quot;One
of
my
happiest
discoveries
on
the
Internet
has
been
Sondra&#39;s
ceramic
dog
tiles.
The
dog
faces
are
so
realistic
and
every
dog
tile
she
has
made
for
me
has
looked
exactly
like
the
picture
I
sent
her.
She
responds
quickly
to
any
questions
and
it
is
obvious
that
this
is
more
than
just
a
business
to
her...she
puts
her
heart
into
her
artwork.
It
is
a
pleasure
to
give
her
artwork
as
a
gift
and
a
thrill
to
see
how
happy
it
makes
my
friends
when
they
open
it!!!
There
are
a
lot
of
dog
items
out
there
to
buy....but
Sondra&#39;s
artwork
gives
a
person
a
special
remembrance
of
their
dog
that
they
will
treasure
forever.&quot;
\r\n\r\n-Jacquie

got
the
Bingo
tile
today,
he
is
absolutely
beautiful,
I
can&#39;t
wait
to
give
it
to
my
friend
for
her
b-day.
Thank
you
so
much.&quot;
\r\n\r\n-
Renee
Miller\r\n\r\n\r\nI
received
the
tile
today
and
I
just
wanted
to
thank
you
so
much.
More
beautiful

for!

Blood
Jaguar-
Mayan
bloodletting
sculpture
A
jaguar
priestess
draws
a
thorn
studded
rope
through
a
piercing
in
her
lip
to
draw
blood
to
appease
the
gods.
The
blood
spatters
onto
slips
of
paper
with
the
names
of
the
mayan
lords
seeking
the
gods
favor.\r\n\r\n&quot;Blood
Jaguar&quot;
features
all
kinds
of
details
from
the
subtle
sparkle
on
the
quetzel
feather
headdress,
to
the
stone
heads
on
the
altar,
to
the
authentic
mayan
name
glyph
on
her
slips
of
paper
(for
the
ruler
Bird
Jaguar),
to
the
tiny
knots
in
the
cords
that
tie
her
jewelry
on.\r\n\r\nThe
design
of
&quot;Blood
Jaguar&quot;
is
inspired
by
a
8th
century
stone
carving
of
Lady
Xoc
making
a
similar
sacrificial
offering.
The
colors
of
her
outfit
are
based
on
temple
paintings
from
a
similar
period.
\r\n\r\nBlood
Jaguar
is
8&quot;
(20CM)
tall
at
top
of
headdress
and
roughly
6&quot;
(15CM)
across
the
horizontal
axis.

Coral
Stitch
Necklace
-
Salmon
The
coraling
stitch
in
beadwork
creates
branches
of
beads,
usually
done
in
one
color,
and
with
the
last
bead
(tip
of
the
branch)
done
in
an
accent
color.
Coraling
creates
a
unique
and
rich
looking
piece
that
looks
just
like
coral
branches
in
the
ocean.
It
is
a
time
consuming
stitch,
but
the
resulting
piece
is
worth
the
work.
This
necklace
is
done
in
salmon
colored
glass
seed
beads,
with
dark
red
glass
seed
beads
providing
the
accents.
The
coral
branches
fall
from
a
delicate
chain
worked
from
the
same
colored
beads.
Wearable
length
for
this
necklace
is
16
1\\\\/2&quot;.
The
chain
is
about
1\\\\/4&quot;
wide.
The
longest
coral
branch
in
the
center
is
2
1\\\\/2&quot;
long
graduating
to
shorter
lengths
toward
the
sides.
The
actual
width
of
the
coraled
section
of
this
piece
is
4
1\\\\/2&quot;
long.
There
is
a
gold
tone
S-hook
and
loop
closure.

Bette
Davis
Origami
Peace
Crane
Permanent
Ornament
On
April
5,
2008
Bette
Davis
would
have
been
100
years
old\r\n\r\nRuth
Elizabeth
&quot;Bette&quot;
Davis
(April
5,
1908
–
October
6,
1989)
was
a
two-time
Academy
Award-winning
American
actress
of
film,
television
and
theater.
Noted
for
her
willingness
to
play
unsympathetic
and
often
ruthless
characters,
she
was
highly
regarded
for
her
performances
in
a
range
of
film
genres;
from
contemporary
crime
melodramas
to
historical
and
period
films
and
occasional
comedies,
though
her
greatest
successes
were
romantic
dramas.\r\n\r\nAfter
appearing
in
Broadway
plays,
Davis
moved
to
Hollywood
in
1930,
but
her
early
films
for
Universal
Studios
were
unsuccessful.
She
joined
Warner
Bros.
in
1932
and
established
her
career
with
several
critically
acclaimed
performances.
In
1937,
she
attempted
to
free
herself
from
her
contract
and
although
she
lost
a
well-publicized
legal
case,
it
marked
the
beginning
of
the
most
successful
period
of
her
career.
Until
the
late
1940s,
she
was
one
of
American
cinema&#39;s
most
celebrated
leading
actresses,
known
for
her
forceful
and
intense
style.
Davis
gained
a
reputation
as
a
perfectionist
who
could
be
highly
combative,
and
her
confrontations
with
studio
executives,
film
directors
and
costars
were
often
reported.
Her
forthright
manner,
clipped
vocal
style
and
ever-present
cigarette
contributed
to
a
public
persona
which
has
often
been
imitated
and
satirized.\r\n\r\nDavis
was
the
co-founder
of
the
Hollywood
Canteen,
and
was
the
first
female
president
of
the
Academy
of
Motion
Picture
Arts
and
Sciences.
She
was
the
first
actor
to
receive
10
Academy
Award
nominations
and
the
first
woman
to
receive
a
Lifetime
Achievement
Award
from
the
American
Film
Institute.
Her
career
went
through
several
periods
of
decline,
and
she
admitted
that
her
success
had
often
been
at
the
expense
of
her
personal
relationships.
Married
four
times,
she
was
once
widowed
and
three
times
divorced,
and
raised
her
children
as
a
single
parent.
Her
final
years
were
marred
by
a
long
period
of
ill
health,
but
she
continued
acting
until
shortly
before
her
death
from
breast
cancer,
with
more
than
100
film,
television
and
theater
roles
to
her
credit.\r\n\r\nIn
1999,
Davis
was
placed
second,
behind
Katharine
Hepburn,
on
the
American
Film
Institute&#39;s
list
of
the
greatest
female
stars
of
all
time.

This
sign
would
look
great
with

Very
primitive
country
chic
sign!
I
painted
the
word
FAITH
with
pink
roses
on
each
side
on
a
recycled
board.
The
background
is
Light
Robin&#39;s
Egg
Blue
and
the
edges
Soft

The
painting
was
done
with
a
crackle
finish,
distressed
and
signed.
It
is
11

long,
3

and
3\\\\/4&quot;

I
attatched
a
rusty

hanger
with
rusty
nails
to
the
top
for
a
very
prim
look.

HOURS
FREE
BRACELET
This
is
an
amazing
bracelet
constructed
from
a
Chinese
bakery
tin
in
purple
and
orange
by
Harriete
Estel
Berman
from
recycled
tin
cans.\r\n\r\nWhen
you
wear
this
bracelet
everyone
will
want
to
meet
you,
and
see
what
you
are
wearing.
I
know,
it
happens
to
me
all
the
time!
When
you
are
not
wearing
this
bracelet
\r\n
-hang
it
on
the
wall\r\n
-stand
it
on
edge
for
display\r\n\r\nThe
muted
purples
side
has
orange
swirls.
A
metallic
gold
medallion
and
Chinese
characters
also
decorate
this
side.\r\n\r\nThe
other
side
says
“1045
Hours
Free!”
using
a
white
tin
from
an
AOL
CD.
It
has
a
rainbow
swirl
center
stripe
continuing
the
&quot;swirly
theme&quot;
on
this
bracelet.\r\n\r\nThe
outside
of
this
bracelet
is
about
1\\\\/2&quot;
wide.
The
tin
is
red
with
swirls
and
curly
cues
wraps
over
both
sides
of
the
outside
edge
with
scallops.\r\n\r\nInside
the
wrist
is
red
with
metallic
gold
lines.
The
scallops
wrap
around
both
sides.
The
wrist
is
2
9\\\\/16&quot;
in
diameter
fitting
a
medium
sized
hand.
If
you
want
to
wear
the
bracelet
and
are
concerned
about
how
the
bracelet
will
fit
your
hand,
write
to
me
and
ask
me
to
send
a
paper
template.
\r\n\r\nThe
bracelet
is
made
from
recycled
tin
cans
which
are
very
clean
with
only
one
faint
scratch.
This
is
really
amazing
considering
that
all
this
material
had
another
life
as
consumer
packaging.

Title:
Cassia
\r\nSize:

\r\nMedia:

Limited
Edition
Print
\r\n\r\nIf
you
missed
out
on
the
original
of
Cassia,
now
is
your
chance
to
still
get
a
one
of
a
kind
original
print
of
her
at
a
reasonable
price!
I
call
it
a
one
of
a
kind
original
print,
because
each
one
will
be
unique,
even
from
the
original!
Cassia
was
photo-quality
printed
with
an
8-color
printing
process
on
thick,
durable
paper
with
a
matte
finish.
I
then
hand
painted
details
onto
the
print
to
make
her
truly
unique.
Only
20
of
these
hand-embellished
8
x
10&quot;
prints
of
Cassia
will
ever
be
made.\r\n\r\nThe
paper
that
Cassia
is
printed
on
measures
8.5
x
11&quot;
while
the
actual
print
area
is
8
x
10.&quot;
This
gives
you
a
small
white
border
around
the
print
making
it
super
easy
to
frame
it!\r\n\r\nOn
Cassia
in
particular,
I
have
painted
many
details,
like
her
outfit,
in
a
metallic
ink
to
give
them
a
soft
shimmer.
On
the
back
I
have
hand
printed
the
title,
the
words
“hand
embellished,”
and
then
I
signed
and
dated
the
card.
This
is
really
as
close
to
the
original
as
you
can
get!!\r\n\r\nWhen
you
purchase
this
item,
you
will
be
given
a
print
with
a
random
number
between
2-19.
Most
likely
I
will
put
the
first
and
last
print
of
the
edition
in
an
auction
style
listing,
so
be
on
the
lookout
for
those!\r\n\r\nI
also
have
a
wide
variety
of
hand
embellished
limited
edition
prints
in
my
store,
as
well
as
magnets,
stickers,
and
bookmarks
featuring
all
of
my
most
popular
art!
Thanks
for
checking

Backstreet
Boys
Skirt
Made
From
Recycled
Tshirts
Size
Medium
Adjustable
Waist
I
handmade
this
one
of
a
kind
t-shirt
skirt
out
of
two
t-shirts.
This
tskirt
is
as
comfy
as
it
is
practical.
Since
it
is
made
of
tshirts
it
is
easily
laundered
just
toss
in
the
washer
and
dryer.
It
has
a
double
drawstring
that
ties
flatteringly
above
each
hip.
The
jersey
fabric
is
slightly
stretchy
and
allows
some
give
where
ever
you
need
it.
This
would
be
a
great
skirt
for
hot
days
on
the
beach,
summer
concerts,
Jazz
Fest,
festivals
such
as
Burning
Man
or
just
watching
tv
and
being
a
couch
potato.\r\n\r\nWaist
at
largest
is
30&quot;
(76
cm)
and
17.75&quot;
(43cm)
in
length.\r\n\r\nI
have
many
other
t-shirt
skirts
for
sale
you
may
also
want
to
check
out.\r\n\r\nThank
you
for
checking
out
my
work.
I
put
a
lot
of
work
\r\ninto
each
piece
and
use
a
serger
as
well
as
sewing
machine
to
ensure
strong
pieces.\r\n\r\nWhy
Buy
Trashion?\r\nTrashion
is
one
of
the
fashion
world’s
most
underground
but
exploding
trends.
Using
what
others
have
discarded
to
create
amazing
new
art
pieces
and
apparel
is
a
way
to
promote
recycling
as
well
as
beating
quick
fads
in
fashion.
By
wearing
upcycled
garments
you
are
taking
part
in
promoting
a
green
trend.
Hopefully
others
will
want
to
participate
in
what
you
are
demonstrating
simply
by
looking
so
cool
in
your
new
old
clothes.
In
addition
to
promoting
recycling
and
green
thinking,
trashion
is
a
way
to
stand
up
against
big
business
and
factory
human
rights
violations
around
the
world.
American
independent
fashion
designers
have
a
tough
job
competing
with
prices
of
clothing
made
in
Asia
and
Central
America.
The
cost
of
fabric
in
America
is
usually
more
than
the
cost
of
a
garment
already
made
and
ready
for
sale.
In
addition,
that
bought
fabric
was
probably
made
at
those
same
factories
that
we
are
embarrassed
to
support.
Trashion
allows
us
to
really
give
them
a
run
for
their
money.
Since
vintage
clothing
and
materials
are
cheap
and
widely
available
it
is
a
great
source
of
relatively
cheap
materials
allowing
us
to
put
more
paid
time
into
its
artistic
construction.
Consider
all
the
oil
saved
when
vintage
fabrics
are
used
instead
of
new
ones
shipped
in
from
all
over
the
world.
Think
of
all
the
landfill
space
that
can
be
saved
by
reusing
materials.
Imagine
how
many
less
natural
resources
are
consumed
by
not
having
to
make
another
yard
of
fabric.
Another
benefit
of
trashion
is
that
the
materials
are
just
so
awesome.
Vintage
fabrics
can
often
offer
more
than
their
fabric
store
competition.
Often
times,
great
vintage
patterns
or
graphics
allow
for
one
of
a
kind
pieces
to
take
shape.
Vintage
fabrics
can
also
provide
superior
qualities
of
that
particular
type
of
fabric.
For
instance
a
wool
sweater
re-worked
into
a
funky
pair
of
legwarmers
may
provide
a
customer
more
quality
for
their
money
since
the
price
of
the
wool
from
the
fabric
store
could
run
more
than
the
retail
price
of
those
upcycled
funky
new
legwarmers.
Recycled
fabrics
often
have
been
washed
many
times
and
are
therefore
unlikely
to
shrink
or
fade-
since
they
probably
already
did.
Lastly,
and
perhaps
most
cool,
is
that
trashion
pieces
are
often
one
of
a
kind
fashion
art
that
could
truly
never
be
replicated.
When
you
buy
trashion
pieces
you
are
supporting
a
lot
of
great
causes
and
concepts
including
a
greener
planet,
more
independent
designers,
not
participating
in
human
rights
violations,
as
well
as
great
original
pieces
made
from
fabulous
fabrics.
Make
the
world
a
better
place
and
buy
trashion.
You’ll
be
glad
you
did!

God
is
My
art
is
collage.
And
I
will
uses
what
ever
I
can
get
my
hands
on
to
make
it
work.
My
pieces
usually
take
a
religious
and\\\\/or
urban
tone.
With
my
work
I
try
to
take
a
subject
and
work
it
from
the
other
point
of
view.
As
of
late
I’ve
been
going
back
to
the
basics,
taking
historical
events
and\\\\/
or
people
and
working
from
there.
I’ve
been
using
pre
1910
news
clippings
and
concepts,
stereotypes,
and
the
billboard,
poster
media
and
pushing
them
as
far
as
I
can.
I
try
not
to
get
caught
up
in
all
the
photoshop
tips
and
tricks
and
try
to
give
my
art
a
more
simple
and
instinctual
look.
I
want
people
to
be
pulled
to
my
art
and
then
forced
to
think.\r\n\r\nWith
my
art
I
try
to
go
for
a
look
and
feel
all
to
its
own.
Using
striking
photographic
imagery,
high
contrast
and
cerebral
play
with
society’s
ideas
of
urban,
inner-city
thinking,
mythology
and
lifestyle
I
try
to
create
art
that
tells
more
of
a
story
then
the
11
o&#39;clock
news.\r\n\r\nEach
piece
is
a
digital
photographic
reproduction
of
the
original
collage
printed
on
matte
or
glossy
8
x
10”
Kodak
paper,
the
perfect
size
for
framing.

Dark

Key
Candy
These
adorable
key
chains
are
amazing!
I
love
how
well
they
hold
up
and
how
sparkly
and
fun
they
are.\r\n\r\nThe
tassels
measure
around
1
1\\\\/2&quot;
and
hang
from
a
3\\\\/4&quot;
split
ring.
You
can
also
remove
the
tassel
jump
ring
from
the
split
ring
and
hang
it
on
a
chain
for
a
fun
necklace,
in
your
car,
on
a
cupboard,
in
a
plant,
or
use
it
as
a
zipper
pull.
Completely
versatile
and
fun!

Sangria
always
makes
me
think
of
celebrating!\r\nSweet,
spicy
or
bubbly,
however
you
like
it...\r\nthis
bright

fruity
concoction
was
made
from
various
jades,
carnelian,
adventurine,
coral,
cat&#39;s
eye,
agate,
a
hand
carved
jasper
bead
and
sterling
silver.\r\n\r\nLightweight
and
easy
to
wear.
It
measures
just
under
8
inches
and
can
be
adjusted
for
a
perfect
fit.
As
always,
I&#39;ve
used
double
crimp
beads
for
added
security.\r\n\r\nThanks

Spill
--
10
x
10
inch
Acrylic
Painting
by
Claire
Jauregui
“Spill”
is
a
fun
10
x
10
inch
acrylic
on
panel
painting
that
I
completed
in
late
2007.
It
has
an
eye-popping
red
background
tempered
by
subdued
chrome
green
clouds.
A
sprinkling
of
red
and
fleshy
rounds
tumble
through
the
foreground
while
a
white
ribbon
of
paint
winds
its
way
through
the
middle
ground.
I
have
signed
and
dated
the
back
of
the
painting.\r\n\r\n“Spill”
is
painted
on
a
10
x
10
inch
cradled
ampersand
panel
that
sits
2.5
inches
off
the
wall.
I
have
painted
the
edges
so
the
work
is
ready
to
hang
without
a
frame.
\r\n\r\n&quot;Spill&quot;
will
be
carefully
packaged
and
priority
mailed
to
you
with
insurance
and
delivery
confirmation
in
the
US.
Outside
the
US
rates
are
for
insured,
priority
mail.
You
are
responsible
for
any
duties
or
tariffs.
If
you
would
like
the
piece
mailed
first
class
or
express,
please
convo
me
and
I
will
provide
you
with
a
quote.
\r\n\r\nPlease
note
that
each

is
copyrighted

as

you

NAIL
POLISHES

By
the
turn
of
the
19th
century,
nails
were
tinted
with
scented
red
oils
and
polished
or
buffed
with
a
chamois
cloth,
rather
than
simply
painted.
English
and
US
19th
century
cookbooks
had
directions
for
making
nail
paints.
In
the
19th
and
early
20th
centuries,
women
pursued
a
polished,
rather
than
painted,
look
by
massaging
tinted
powders
and
creams
into
their
nails,
then
buffing
them
shiny.
One
such
polishing
product
sold
around
this
time
was
Graf’s
Hyglo
nail
polish
paste.
Some
women
during
this
period
painted
their
nails
with
clear,
glossy
varnish
applied
with
a
camel-hair
brush.
When
automobile
paint
was
created
around
1920,
it
inspired
the
introduction
of
colored
nail
enamels.\r\n-Thanks

Apron
Antique
Patches
Aprons.
There
is
something
about
a
unique
apron
that
brings
me
back
to
my
childhood,
making
cookies
or
pancakes
with
big
sisters,
I
will
always
love
aprons.
Made
with
blue
and
white
gingham,
this
one
of
a
kind
apron
will
be
sure
to
keep
you
clean
while
you
are
creating
something
good.
This
piece
is
also
lined
in
soft
white
cotton
and
ties
with
yellow
ribbon.
To
hold
some
spoons
or
recipe
cards
I
appliquéd
two
antique
quilt
patches
onto
the
front,
but
don’t
worry
I
left
the
top
open
so
that
you
can
actually
use
these
pockets.
As
always
this
apron
was
designed
and
made
my
me.
I
hope
that
this
piece
will
make
you
smile.
Bon
appetite!

The
decorative
twill
known
as
&quot;quadrifoil&quot;
is
the
most
difficult
of
any
Shaker
design
to
weave
because
the
middle
of
each
side
and
each
corners
are
woven
with
different
patterns
at
the
same
time.
Quadrifoil
designs
appear
exclusively
in
“fancy”
baskets
from
the
Mt.
Lebanon
Shaker
Community.
Fancy
Baskets
were
delicate
and
intricately
woven
baskets
Shakers
made
to
sell
to
people
outside
the
Shaker
Community.
\r\n\r\nThis
spectacular

is

Lady
Bird
Incognito
This
is
the
story
of
a
bird
that
loved
shopping
but
everybody
knows
that
birds
are
not
allowed
in
stores.
So
she
would
disguise
herself
until
one
day
they
caught
her!
...in
an
alley
way
and
she
dropped
her
bags
and
the
papparazzi
snapped
this
photo
of
her.
The
newspapers
dubbed
her
&quot;Lady
Bird
Incognito&quot;.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis
necklace
features
a
fine
silver
pendant
that
has
been
handcrafted
by
me.
The
drawing
of
the
bird
is
my
original
artwork.
She
is
made
separately
and
then
joined
to
the
fine
silver
&quot;brick
wall&quot;.
This
pendant
measures
1&quot;
in
length
and
3\\\\/4&quot;
in
width
and
is
hung
by
2
sterling
silver
jump
rings.
The
pendant
hangs
on
an
18&quot;
sterling
silver
chain.\r\n\r\nPlease
leave
a
note
during
checkout
if
you
would

Gemstone

been
a

ever
since

It

for

here
is
a

It
is

Punches
These
sweet
little
butterflies
are
created
by
me
using
a
hand
punch.
I
made
some
envelopes
from
a
1970&#39;s
National
Geographic
World
Atlas
and
used
the
left
over
scraps
to
punch
out
these
butterflies.
They
can
be
used
for
so
many
paper
crafts
like
card
making,
scrapbooking,
journaling,
decoupage,
or
even
confetti
for
decorating.
They
are
about
3\\\\/4&quot;
across.\r\n\r\nCustom
orders
are
always
welcome
so
let
me
know
if
you
need
more.
I

as
you

for
only

each.\r\n\r\nCrafted

Buttons
up
the

with
self-fabric
covered
buttons
and
has
two
of
the
same
self-fabric
buttons
on
each
cuff.
Strangely
enough,
two
extra
buttons
are
supplied,
but
we
found
them
in
the
oddest
place
-
tacked
under
the
arm
on
the
outside!
Once
your
new
dress
arrives,
you
will
want
to
clip
them
off
and
put
them
in
a
safe
place.\r\n\r\nThis
had
belonged
to
my
mother.
I
found
it
in
a
drawer
of
her
garments
from
the
very
late
60&#39;s
to
early
70&#39;s.
Since
the
extra
buttons
are
still
in
place,
I
assume
she
never
wore
this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMeasurements
of
the
garment
itself:\r\n\r\nBust\\\\/Chest:

It&#39;s
created
from
a
photo
I
took
in
downtown
Dallas
and
then
altered
in
Photoshop,
printed
on
Epson
Premium
glossy

paper,
layerd
on
cardstock,
and
then
run
through
Xyron
with
lamination
on
one
side
and
magnet
on
the
other.
I
cut
it
out
by
hand
and
rim
the
edges
with
black
ink.\r\n\r\nPerfect
for
the
fridge
or
a

Copper
chain
with
hand
made
clasp
An
elegant
copper
chain
with
a
hand
made
clasp
perfectly
sets
off
my
copper
wrapped
pendants!
If
you
like
my
pendants
and
are
looking
for
an
elegant
way
to
wear
them,
consider
this
chain!
The
chain
pictured
is
20
inches
long,
but
any
length
is
available.
If
you
would
like
a
different
length
just
add
the
size
to
your
Etsy
comment
during
checkout.\r\n\r\nThis
antique
copper
chain
is
copper
plated
steel.
It
is
vintage,
so
there
may
be
some
variation
in
the
coloring
along
the
chain
due
to
age.
Personally,
I
think
this
adds
dramatically
to
the
beauty
of
the
chain!
\r\n\r\nThe
handmade
clasp
is
100%
copper.\r\n\r\nThe
pendant
in
the
photo
is
not
included
in
this
listing.
I
have
added
a
picture
to
show
how
well
this
chain
works
with
my
wire
wrapped
pendants.
\r\n\r\nThanks
for
viewing
my
listing
and
have
a
GREAT
day!

Approx.

x

11.5&quot;H
and
handle

I
originally
designed
this
personalized
diaper
bag
for
showers
and
birthday
gifts
for
family
and
friends,
but
it
is
great
for
just
about
anything.
Book
bag,
overnight
bag,
toy
bag,
goodie
bag,
etc.
The
top
portion
of
this
bag
is
khaki,
and
the
bottom
has
a
light
sea
blue
base
with
khaki
outlined
flower
pattern.
Accented
with
a
chocolate
grosgrain
ribbon.
The
inside
of
the
bag
is
lined
with
coordinating
fabric
and
two
pockets
on
one
side.
I
make
all
my
bags
with
med.
to
heavy
weight
fabric
so
they
have
form
and
durability,
but
not
too
stiff.
They
are
easy
to
wash
and
pack
away.
All
my
items
come
from
a
smoke

home\r\n\r\nThe
additional
pictures
displayed
are
examples
of
what
the
personalization
of
the
bags
can
look
like.

REDUCED
FROM
13.OO\r\nNothing
says
Spring
and
Summer
like
a
colorful
straw

Check

The
really

door
as
a
Spring

I
just
grab
it
to
wear
on
my
way
out
to
the
garden,
then
on
the
return
trip,
hang
it
back
up.
I
always
know
where
to
find
it.
Now
if
I
could
just
find
a
easy
way

find
the

Each

shouts
the
fact
that
Summer

Purchase
one

It

of

I
have
grooved
and
wrapped
with
Sterling
silver
wire
with
a
fisherman&#39;s

could
be
a
charm
in
larger
creation,
a

or
use
your
imagination!

All
my
votives
are
taller
and
more
tapered
than
many
votives
so
it
is
best
to
burn
them
in
a
v-shaped\\\\/tapered
votive
holder.
You
can
burn
them
in
most
holders,
but
to
get
the
most
burn
time,
burn
in
a
tight
fitting
one.
The
shape
does
not
affect
the
burn
time.

Huckleberry
clock
features
my
original
psychedelic
mandala
design,
hand
painted
using
high
quality
acrylics
in
blue,
violet,
and

\r\n\r\nIt

This

step
towards
going
&quot;green&quot;
for

\r\n\r\nMandalas
can
also
aid
in
meditation
or
make
you
feel
more
calm
and
peaceful
-
who
wouldn&#39;t
like
that?\r\n\r\nThe

clock
movement
and
simple
white

Oglala
Beadwoven
Bracelet
with
Ceramic
Beads
(2823)
I
absolutely
love
making
these
bracelets!
The
Oglala
pattern,
which
is
so
named
for
the
beadworkers
of
the
Lakota
nation
in
South
Dakota
who
are
credited
with
the
stitch
(according
to
&#39;Mastering
Beadwork&#39;),
is
such
fun
to
create.
I
love
watching
the
ruffles
as
they
form.\r\n\r\nThe
ruffles
on
this
bracelet
are
formed
with
size
11
glossy
black
Czech
glass
beads.
The
picot
edging
is
made
from
pale
gray
beads
that
are
lined
with
white.
The
whole
bracelet
was
designed
around
the
ceramic
beads
that
make
up
the
center.
The
ceramic
beads
are
mostly
white,
but
they
have
black
speckles
on
them
and
edges
that
are
a
mottled
dark
khaki
color.
They&#39;re
oh-so-slightly
twisted,
too,
and
I
just
love
them!\r\n\r\nThe
closure
is
a
loop
and
toggle
made
from
the
black
beads.\r\n\r\nAlthough
it&#39;s
created
with
neutral
colors,
this
bracelet
is
still
sure
to
draw
some
attention
to
your
wrist
when
you
wear
it!\r\n\r\nThe
bracelet
measures
approximately
7-3\\\\/4&quot;
in
diameter,
when
clasped.\r\n\r\nYour
bracelet
will
arrive
in
a
beautiful
little
box,
perfect
for
giving
to
someone
special
or
to
yourself!\r\n\r\n**********************************************************\r\n\r\nSIZING
and
CUSTOM
COLORS\r\nIf
you
really
like
the
look
of
this
piece
but
would
like
something
in
different
colors
or
a
different
length,
send
me
a
note!
I&#39;d
be
happy
to
create
something
custom
for
you.\r\n\r\nBEAD

This
is
a

myself.
After

finished
painting,
I
applied
an

for
a

for
protection(does
not
mean
she
can
be
left
out
to
nature&#39;s

though).
On
the

I
have
attached
hanging
wire
and
the
edges
are
painted
for

look.
No

CRIMSON
BLUE

Hello!
This
is
a
smaller
purse
than
some
I&#39;ve
done
in
the
past,
but
what
a
statement!
With
its
bold
red,
royal
blue,
and
sunny
yellow,
it
is
both
patriotic
and
happy.
It&#39;s
petite
size
is
perfect
for
just
the
necessities.\r\n
I
started
with
a
new
purse,
that
had
yellow
vinyl
trim,
bottom,
and
lining,
as
well
as
a
silver
metal
ornament.
I
added
my
own
crocheted
motifs
in
geometric
shapes,
sewn
by
hand
to
the
purse.
I
used
fun
furs,
acrylic,
worsted
weight,
ribbon,
and
a
few
others.
And,
just
for
whimsy,
I
scattered
a
few
brightly
colored
beads,
too.
If
you
are
a
Kansas
Jayhawks
fan
(yes,
the
2008
National
Champions
of
NCAA
mens
basketball!),
this
purse
is
perfect
to
go
with
your
Crimson
and
Blue!
Rockchalk
Jayhawk,
GO
KU!!\r\n
This
little
handbag
measures
4
1\\\\/2&quot;
tall,
about
10&quot;
wide
at
the
bottom
(the
top
is
a
little
narrower),
and
2
1\\\\/2&quot;
from
front
to
back
(measured
on
the
side.
It
closes
with
velcro
at
the
top
inner
aspect
of
the
purse.\r\n
I
took
pictures
from
several
angles
so
you
can
see
all
sides
of
the
bag.

The

Enlightenment\r\nA
zine
on
the
intersection
of
Buddhism
and
polyamory.\r\n\r\nIssue
2,
August
2007\r\n\r\nIn
Buddhism,
we
take
refuge
in
the
three
jewels:
Buddha,
Dharma,
and
Sangha.
If
examined
closely,
any
spiritual
path
will
have
ways
in
which
teachers,
teachings,
and
community
are
there
to
give
refuge.
These
fulfill
a
deep
instinctual
need
for
us
social
animals.\r\n\r\nIn
this
issue
I
look
for
these
three
gems
as
they
relate
to
polyamory.\r\n\r\n

HANDCRAFTED
Turquoise
Slice
Necklace
with
Exotic
Rudruksha
Beads\\\\/Jade\\\\/Abalone
Long
Chunky
Talk
about
original
and
one-of-a-kind
art
to
wear,
this
creation
in
pleasing
shades
of
turquoise,
blues,
earthtones
and
silver
features
a
uniquely
formed
natural
copper
turquoise
slice
focal
bead
(approximately
1-3\\\\/4”
x
1-1\\\\/2”
x
¼”),..a
serious
slice
of
turquoise
indeed!
I
then
combined
it
with
smaller
turquoise
slices,
some
totally
unique
beads
called
“Rudraksha,”
copper,
carved
jade,
wood
rondelles,
abalone,
and
two
blue\\\\/brown
rectangular
stones
I
seem
to
have
lost
my
identification
on,
but
I
believe
they
are
blue
crazy
lace
agate.
It
measures
28”
long
from
the
“S”
hook
clasp
to
the
tip
of
the
focal
bead.\r\n\r\nTurquoise
is
a
healer
of
spirit,
used
in
ancient
times
to
protect
against
accidents.
It
has
a
soothing
energy
which
brings
peace
of
mind.
It
acts
to
induce
wisdom
and
understanding,
and
to
enhance
trust,
kindness
and
recognition
of
beauty.\r\n\r\nRudraksha
–
The
power
beads
which
are
always
looked
upon
as
Mystic,
holy,
divine
and
auspicious
in
India.
Buddha
wore
these
beads,
so
did
Gandhi,
Dalai
Lama
and
the
enlightened
Indian
Yogis.
Most
will
be
pleasantly
surprised
to
find
that
the
belief
is
that
merely
on
wearing
the
Rudraksha
Beads
one
begins
to
feel
a
deep
level
of
calmness
of
mind
and
a
lower
level
of
stress
&
anxiety.
Depression
and
melancholia
is
something
the
Rudraksha
Beads
can
allegedly
heal
outright.\r\nAncient
Indian
medical
texts
claim
that
the
Rudraksha
prevents
aging
and
can
prolong
life.
Rudraksha
is
said
to
Belong
to
Lord
Shiva.
Those
who
wear
Rudraksha
are
believed
to
be
free
from
the
mother
of
all
fears
that
haunts
all
living
beings
-
The
fear
of
death
and
extinction.
The
beads
are
supposed
to
be
anti-pyretic,
anti-paralysis
and
can
help
balance
the
vital
chakras
of
the
human
body
which
controls
bile,
wind
and
phlegm.
It
is
also
said
to
heal
those
suffering
from
hypertension
and
heart
ailments.
Besides,
as
it
is
completely
without
any
side
effects
it
cannot
do
you
any
harm.
\r\n\r\nAbalone,
a
shell,
is
found
to
be
very
healing
for
the
wearer,
especially
for
the
first
three
chakras.
Like
the
sounds
of
water,
it
can
be
very
calming
and
is
valuable
while
working
through
past
and
present
emotional
situations.\r\n\r\nAgate
can
be
used
to
stimulate
analytical
capabilities
and
precision.
It
provides
for
perceptiveness
to
situations
and
awakens
ones
inherent
talents.
It
is
reported
to
strengthen
sight,
diminish
thirst,
and
promote
marital
fidelity.

If
you
can
think
of
something
you
would

better
please
let
me
know.
I
love
special
orders!\r\n\r\nYou
will
get
1
dozen
baby
cakes
tarts
with
this
order.
They
will
come
wrapped
in
a
cello
bag
tied
with
homespun.
Perfect
for
bringing
with
you
to
a
dinner
party
as
a
hostess
gift.
You
will
also
get
a
free
sample
of
another
scent.\r\n\r\nI
hand
pour
all
my
tarts
in
my
shop.
I
use
a
soy
paraffin
blend
wax.
You
get
the
benefits
of
soy
but
the
paraffin
lets
the
tart
come
out
of
the
burner
so
much
easier!
I
will
pour
your
tarts
fresh
for
you.\r\n\r\n1
melt
will
give
you
approximately
8-12
hours
of
fragrance.
When
the
scent
is
gone
just
let
the
wax
harden,
set
in
freezer
for
1\\\\/2
hour
and
it
will
pop
right
out.\r\n\r\nThanks
for
stopping
by.
Please
come
back
soon!\r\n

usually
use
fishhook
wires
on
my
earrings

I
do

kidney
wires
and
ball
posts
if
you
prefer
either
one
of
those.
Most
of
my
earrings
can
also
be
converted
to
clip-ons.
I
have
the
pierced
look
or
4mm
half
ball
findings.
All
you
need
do
is
ask
and
would
gladly
convert
them
for
you.\r\n\r\nShipping

TWO
Wedding
bands
in
argentium
sterling
silver
PRICE
FOR
TWO
WEDDING
BANDS.\r\nWith
these,
no
one
can
ever
say
again
“Oh,
I
didn&#39;t
see
the
band&quot;.
Organically
simple,
this
is
what
I
truly
love
about
these
bands.
This
is
the
matching
set
to
the
engagement
ring,
the
specs
are
the
same.
This
is
the
band
the
woman
receives
free
when
buying
the
engagement
ring
(only
if
buying
the
man&#39;s
band
also).\r\n\r\nThe
shank
is
a
solid
2.90
mm
wide
3.20
mm
thick
Argentium
Sterling
Silver.
Basically
it
is
a
little
over
a
1/8
inch
square.
This
ring
is
high
polished
but
can
be
made
with
a
satin
finish.
\r\n\r\nThis
is
the
price
for
TWO
rings,
if
ordering
without
the
engagement
ring.
If
you
are
ordering
this
set
WITH
the
engagement
1/2
of
your
cost
will
be
refunded
through
PayPal
OR
you
may
convo
me
and
I
will
add
a
special
listing
with
the
cost
of
one
ring.
The
same
deal
goes
if
you
are
just
ordering
one
ring.\r\n\r\n\r\nSORRY,
THIS
ENGAGEMENT
RING
HAS
BEEN
SOLD.
I
can
custom
make
another,
PLEASE
keep
in
mind
that
each
diamond
is
one
of
a
kind.
\r\nThis
EXACT
ring
is
sold
I
have
ONE
similar,
the
others
are
with:
earth
tone,
silver
and
a
black
diamonds.I
will
send
you
a
photo
of
the
diamond
I
will
use
before
it
is
set
(
for
custom
orders
only).
\r\n\r\nIf
you
are
not
getting
married,
keep
in
mind,
you
can
also
buy
them
as
the
ultimate
stack
rings.
You
can
buy
just
one
ring
also,
see
other
listing.\r\nFeel
free
to
ask
for
custom
orders\r\n
\r\n\r\nThis
ring
is
amazingly
comfortable.
I
thought
the
shank
would
be
uncomfortable
but
it&#39;s
not.
Woman
who
have
worn
these
rings
have
been
giving
me
great
testimony
on
the
comfort.\r\n\r\nAs
wedding
bands,
these
rings
are
very
special,
if
for
ANY
reason
they
do
not
feel
comfortable,
Convo
me
and
I
will
do
all
I
can
to
make
them
work,
up
to
making
them
thinner.\r\n\r\n

Handpainted
Porcelain
Chinese
Beads
and
Freshwater
Pearls
Necklace
Do
you
like
the
look
and
feel
of
pearls?
Here
is
a
great
combination
of
lavendar
button
freshwater
pearls
and
handpainted
Chinese
porcelain
beads.\r\n\r\nI
selected
these
striking
Chinese
beads
for
thier
unique
designs.
Since
they
are
handpainted
no
two
are
exactly
alike
but
all
of
very
similar
designs.
I
selected
longer
tube
beads
to
go
with
the
oval,
almost
egg
shape
of
the
similar
beads.
Adding
the
lavendar
freshwater
button
pearls
lends
a
classic
look
to
this
necklace.\r\n\r\nThe
necklace
is
about
19&quot;
long.

Sister
Cat
Mask
Sister
Cat
\r\n\r\nLimited
Edition
Sculpture,
artist
proof
\r\n\r\n9.25&quot;
long
by
7&quot;
wide
by
2&quot;
high\r\n(about
23.5cm
x
18cm
x
5cm)\r\n\r\nI&#39;ve
always
thought
cat&#39;s
faces
were
very
intriguing.
This
Sister
Cat
was
the
first
of
my
4
cat
mask
designs,
and
I
still
have
an
idea
in
my
head
for
one
more
to
follow
someday.
\r\n\r\nI
think
this
is
the
most
striking
of
my
cats,
with
the
movement
of
the
sleek
angles
contrasting
the
serene
almost
meditative
expression
on
her
face.
Lots
of
people
think
she
looks
quite
Art
Deco,
but
she’s
also
Modern,
Cubist,
and
certainly
Egyptian
influenced...
I
think
you’ll
love
this
piece!
She’s
a
true
contemporary
cat
icon.
\r\n\r\nThe
glaze
is
one
of
my
favorites.
It
took
years
to
perfect,
and
I
call
it
Diamond
Black.
As
you
can
see,
it’s
very
difficult
to
photo
effectively!
I
describe
it
as
a
deep
satin
black,
with
micro
crystals.
It
reflects
silver
in
the
highlights,
and
has
undertones
of
dark
green
and
blue.
Probably
the
most
overall
representative
picture
of
the
color,
is
the
one
with
Mary
K
holding
her.\r\n\r\nThis
work
comes
with
a
signed
certificate
of
authenticity,
and
is
marked
in
the
clay
&quot;DMH&quot;,
A48**.\r\n\r\nAll
my
work
comes
with
an
unconditional
lifetime
guarantee.\r\n(more
info
in
my
profile)\r\n\r\nThanks
for
your
interest!\r\n\r\nI&#39;m
certain
that
this
Sister
Cat
Mask
will
make
a
fine
addition
to
your
collection,
or
a
really
great
gift.\r\n\r\nIf

Needle
Felted
Dog
German
Shepherd
Wool
Sculpture
by
Artist
Karen
Clothier
This
needle
felted
German
Shepherd
was
sculpted
by
Artist
Karen
CLothier~\r\nIt
will
surely
make
a
fine
addition
to
your
dog
collection!
I
used
very
soft
wool
roving
to
sculpt
this
little
mini
and
many
creative
hours
of
my
time~\r\nThis
tiny
sculpture
was
done
without
the
use
of
a
pattern,
as
all
of
my
designs~\r\n\r\n
I
used
a
glass
nose
and
eyes
and
a
wire
armature
which
allows
it
to
be
&quot;gently&quot;
posed.
This
is
NOT
a
toy
as
it
must
be
handled
gently,
it
will
make
a
great
collector&#39;s
dog.
\r\nThese
beautiful
dogs
take
me
anywhere
from
20
to
30
hours
to
complete
so
the
attention
to
detail
is
superb~\r\n\r\nI
will
make
other
breeds
if
you
are
interested
in
one
that
is
not
listed
we
can
do
a
custom
listing.
\r\nConvo
me
with
any
questions~\r\nIt
measures
approximately
6
1/2&quot;
in
length
to
the
tip
of
the
tail
and
is
about
3
1/8&quot;
tall.

Star
Mirrors
Cross
Stitch
E-Pattern
PDF
Format
Up
for
auction
is
a
counted
cross
stitch
pattern
inspired
by
authentic
traditional
Bedouin
and
Palestinian
village
embroidery
motifs,
common
throughout
the
Middle
East.
\r\n\r\nStar
Mirrors\r\n\r\nMotifs:
This
design
was
inspired
by
a
motif
I
found
on
a
scrap
of
embroidery
from
the
1950s
made
in
Beit
Hanina,
on
the
northern
outskirts
of
Jerusalem.
The
motif
has
been
worked
into
a
protective
talisman
shape
and
surrounded
by
a
single
leaf
border.
This
design
uses
light
and
dark
teal
green
as
its
main
colours
and
accents
of
a
myriad
of
other
brights
and
pastels
on
a
black
Aida
background.
\r\n\r\nLevel
of
difficulty:
Fairly
easy.
Patience
required,
but
the
result
is
beautiful!
DMC
No.
8
Pearl
cotton
is
often
used
locally
for
its
texture
and
ease
of
use,
but
if
it
is
not
readily
available
in
the
colours
of
the
pattern,
use
2
strands
of
floss.\r\n\r\nSize:
15
1\\\\/8
inches
wide
by
16
inches
high
on
14
count
black
Aida
cloth,
212
stitches
wide
by
224
stitches
high.
A
margin
of
approximately
1.5
inches
has
been
left
for
mounting.
\r\n\r\nFabric
requirements:
Black
Aida
cloth,
at
least
20
inches
x
20
inches.
\r\n\r\nPossible
uses:
This
design
would
be
very
effective
as
a
table
cloth
center,
a
cushion
cover,
a
wall
hanging,
or
part
of
a
tote
bag.\r\n\r\nFloss
requirements:
see
last
page
of
pattern.
The
star
centers
can
be
done
in
any
bright
or
pastel
colour,
the
more
the
better.
A
good
way
to
use
up
all
those
stray
bits
of
pretty
floss!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis
pattern
has
been
carefully
charted
by
hand
using
motifs
and
colours
from
embroideries
in
my
own
personal
collection,
on
professional
cross-stitch
software.
You
will
receive
a
PDF
format
Adobe
Acrobat
file
containing
both
colour
and
black
and
white
symbol
charts
for
the
design
as
well
as
information
on
its
history
and
technique,
and
a
list
of
thread
colours
to
use.
\r\n\r\nI
will
send
the
pattern
file
to
you
via
email
within
24
hours
of
payment.
Please
ensure
that
your
Paypal
email
address
is
accurate

You
will
need
an
Adobe

\r\n\r\nIf
you
are
like
me,
you
will
want
your
pattern
NOW,
or
at
least
as
soon
as
possible
given
the
differences
in
our
time
zones.
Electronic
delivery
ensures
that
you
receive
it
safely
and
quickly
and
that
you
can
print

or

not
received
your

hours
of

me.
\r\n\r\n\r\nThe
pattern
has
been
designed
for
use
on
Aida
cloth,
but
any
even
or
open
weave
fabric
will
work.
The
background
cloth
colour
is
an
important
part
of
the
design.
It
is
strongly
recommended
that
you
use
the
background
colour
suggested
in
the
pattern,
as
the
effect
of
the
design
on
other
background
colours
will
be
very
different.
Removable
waste
canvas
may
also
be
used.
\r\n\r\nThe
colours
in
your
pattern
have
been
matched
with
the
real
thread
used
in
my
own
work.
Although
colours
may
show
up
differently
on
your
computer
monitor,
the
actual
colours
have
been
carefully
chosen.
I
highly
recommend
using
DMC
no.
8
pearl
cotton
for
greater
authenticity
and
a
better
finished
texture,
but
if
it
is
not
readily
available,
floss
may
be
used.
If
you
would
like
other
colourways,
please
contact
me
and
I
will
try
to
help.
\r\n\r\n\r\nThe
finished
size
of
your
embroidery
will
vary
depending
on
the
number
of
threads
per
inch
in
the
fabric
you
are
using.
The
pattern
has
been
designed
with
a
margin
of
2
inches
(2.5
cm)
of
fabric
around
the
stitching
area
so
that
you
can
mount
it
or
sew
it
into
another
project.
\r\n\r\n\r\n
\r\nThis
is
not
a
kit,
only
a
pattern.
No
fabric
or
threads
are
included.
\r\n\r\nThis
pattern
is
my
original
design
based
on
traditional
motif
elements.
Please
enjoy
it
for
your
own
personal
use.
The
pattern
may
not
be
re-sold
or
re-distributed
in
any
way
without
my
express
permission.
\r\n\r\n
\r\nWhat
you
will
receive:

soon
as
I
receive
your
payment,
I
will
send

Please
allow
up
to
24

due
to

zone
differences.\r\n•\tThe

will
contain
a
colour
block
chart,
a
black
and
white
symbol
chart
of
several
pages
with
overlap
and
a

of
thread
colours
and

Perfect
Day
...
a
Victorian
Keepsake
Card
A
budding
lilac
provided
the
inspiration
for
Perfect
Day.\r\n\r\nEach
card
is
the
representation
of
3+
hours
of
effort.
They
are
not
made
en
masse,
and
each
is
singularly
unique
from
the
next.
I
consider
all
of
my
cards
art,
and
as
such,
they
make
an
exquisite
gift
and
keepsake
for
the
recipient.
As
you
can
see
in
the
last
photo,
each
card
arrives
in
a
beautiful
box
ready
for
wrapping
or
giving.
Also
pictured
is
a
framed
wedding
card
I
made
for
my
daughter
and
son-in-law.
\r\n\r\nCard
Details:
White
card
with
green
sequins,
orchid
ribbon
roses,
silver
touches
in
the
lace
and
lush
gardenias.
INSIDE:
A
small
stamped
rose,
colored
lavender.

Broken
Leaf
2
is
an
original
nature
print.
Nature
prints
are
printed
directly
from
nature&#39;s
bounty
and
generally
fall
into
two
groups.
Plant,
leaf
prints
or
fish,
shell
prints.
For
best
results
all
natural
objects
require
considerable
preparation
before
printing.
Leaves
must
be
properly
pressed
and
dried
and
fish
must
be
carefully
cleaned
of
slime,
dried
and
all
orifices
plugged
or
glued
shut.
Both
plants
and
fish
are
then
artistically
arranged
and
printed
just
like
a
woodcut
block,
but
very
gently!
This
small
leaf
was
fairly
brittle
and
it
disintegrated
as
I
made
several
prints
from
it.
The
process
gave
me
several
different
looking
prints
from
the
same
leaf.
This
one
is
printed
in
red
on
tan
paper
and
is
enhanced
with
green
colored
pencils.
The
leaf
itself
measures
about
2
inches
by
5
inches
and
is
matted
in
white
to
9
inches
by
11
inches.
It
come
wrapped
in
plastic
art
wrap
for
protection
until
you
are
ready
to
frame
it
This
print
would
look
great
in
a
rustic
wood
frame.

in
a
beautiful
aqua
color

The

is
hovering
over
an
herb
garden
in
the
most
peaceful
way,
with
her
sheep
beside
her.
\r\n\r\nInside
the
&quot;basket&quot;
I
have
added
a
matching
floral
arrangement

Classic
Cream
Scarflette
The
Classic
Cream
Scarflette
is
perfect
for
the
unpredictable
Fall
weather,
and
especially
well
suited
for
an
evening
out.
It
fits
very
nicely
tucked
under
the
collar
of
a
coat,
and
looks
really
cute
dressed
up
or
down
-
really
just
a
perfect
essential
piece.
As
the
pictures
showcase,
this
item
can
be
worn
in
many
different
ways
to
compliment
any
outfit.\r\n\r\nThe
yarn
used
for
this
piece
is
a
buttery
soft,
luxury
cotton\\\\/acrylic
blend,
so
it&#39;s
perfectly
safe
for
washing
in
the
machine.
Although,
I
always
recommend
to
handwash
my
items
with
gentle
detergent\\\\/soap,
and
lay
flat
to
dry
as
with
any
knitwear.
The
buttons
are
the
perfect
shade
of
beige
to
compliment
the
creamy
yarn.
\r\n\r\nThis
scarflette
would
make
an
excellent
gift
for
a
loved
one....or
for
yourself!\r\n\r\nMeasurements:\r\nLength:
20
inches
(unstretched)\r\nWidth:
6.5
inches\r\n\r\nAll
my
pieces
are
original
designs,
hand
made
with
time
and
great
care
by
myself.
Items
come
from
a
smoke-free
environment,
and
have
never
been
worn.

Carol&#39;s
Pansies
Little
Bag,
Medium
Size
Little
bags.
Cute
bags
in
different
sizes
to
use
as
a
gift
bag,
purse
for
little
girls,
a
jewelry
pouch
or
makeup
bag.
It’s
5-1\\\\/2”
(14cm)
tall
and
3-1\\\\/2”
(9cm)
in
diameter.
The
ribbon
drawstring
can
be
pulled
from
each
side
for
secure
closing
and
is
long
enough
to
tie
into
a
knot
for
gift
giving.
Left
long,
the
ribbon
fits
easily
over
a
little
girl&#39;s
wrist.
The
ends
of
the
ribbon
have
been
treated
to
reduce
fraying.\r\n\r\nPansies
are
my
mother-in-law
Carol&#39;s
favorite
flower,
so
I&#39;ve
named
it
for
her.
It&#39;s
lined
with
a
pretty
green
fabric,
all
100%
cotton.
Inside
you
will
find
little
pockets,
perfect
for
tucking
earrings
into,
or
maybe
a
ring.
The
base
is
reinforced
with
timtex,
a
thick
interfacing
that
allows
the
bag
to
easily
stand
up
on
its
own.

A
Scrabble
Tile
Necklace
in
a
matching
round
tin
Thanks
for
looking!
This
is
a
lovely
necklace
made
from
a
scrabble
tile
measuring
approximately
.75
inch
square.
I
made
this
necklace
by
adhering
beautiful
Japanese
washi
paper
with
a
gray
flower
and
brown
branch
on
it
to
the
scrabble
tile,
and
then
I
embellished
it
with
tiny
gold
no-hole
beads.
On
top
of
that
is
a
non-toxic
shiny
water
resistant
coating.
It&#39;s
not
waterproof,
so
make
sure
to
remove
it
before
going
into
the
water.\r\n\r\nA
silver-plated
bail
is
attached
to
the
pendant,
and
a
16.5
inch
silver-plated
petite
ball
chain
(1.5
mm)
with
a
lobster
claw
clasp
is
included.
If
you
need
a
longer
length,
just
let
me
know
in
the
&quot;Message
to
Seller&quot;
section
when
you
checkout.
**Please
note**
If
you
request
a
longer
length,
the
ball
chain
will
be
1.8
mm
nickel-plated
with
a
standard
connector.
\r\n\r\nYou
can
give
your
pendant
a
different
look
by
purchasing
one
of
my
leather
cord
necklaces
with
a
sterling
silver
lobster
claw
clasp.\r\n\r\nThis
scrabble
tile
necklace
is
packaged
in
a
coordinating
round
tin
that
measures
.8
by
2
inches.\r\n

OOAK

Tree
Pruitt
(shop
owner).\r\n\r\n
This
is
an
actual
fossilized
portion
of
an
animal
colony,
carefully
hand
cleaned.
A
fully
articulated
bryozoa
fossil
makes
an
attractive
necklace
pendant
in
blue
grey
tones.
The
limestone
fossil
is
mounted
in
a
copper
wire
wrapped
setting,
filled
with
the
magic
of
the
spiral
and
good
fortune.
A
hand
drawn
Nordic
Rune
Ansuz
design,
in
black
and
silver
tone,
features
three
circle
dots
to
represent
all
of
the
powers
of
Three;
Holy
Trinity,
luck,
Triple
Goddess,
realms
of
the
Past,
the
Present,
and
the
Future.
This
art
jewelry
pendant
will
fit
most
chains
and
cords.
Use
this
magic
charm
during
meditation
to
tap
into
the
Akashic
Record
to
gain
ancient
understanding
and
wisdom.
The
type
of
fossil
and
the
rune
chosen,
together
create
an
excellent
combination
to
increase
energy
during
ritual
or
spell
magick,
and
would
be
a
fine
aide
to
the
shaman
in
astral
travel.
(read
properties
below).\r\n\r\n
Being
a
fossil,
this
stone
is
a
link
to
ancient
knowledge;
the
Akashic
Record.
This
type
of
stone
is
said
to
speed
up
the
process
of
absorbing
knowledge
from
the
Akashic
realm
into
oneself.
Fossils
in
general,
from
a
metaphysical
understanding,
may
bring
quality
&
excellence
into
ones
surroundings.
It
may
raise
the
level
of,
and
add
to
ones
achievements
in
the
business
world.
Creativity
may
be
increased
simply
by
the
presence
of
fossil.
Excellent
for
those
who
work
with
stone
Earth
energy,
and
also
Water
energy.
The
wave
like
spiral
of
the
copper
acts
as
a
symbol
of
the
ocean,
which
is
in
itself
a
symbol
of
human
emotions,
rebirth,
and
journey.
Because
of
the
connection
to
a
relatively
unchanged
ancient
sea
bed,
this
pendant
could
help
bring
stability
into
the
wearers
life
and
family
group.\r\n*
Fossil
collection
location
is
from
the
Southwestern
Ohio
Valley,
USA
--
the
Appalachian
Basin,
Cincinnatian.\r\n\r\n*The
Nordic
Rune,
Ansuz
(awn-sooze),
is
a
rune
of
luck,
good
fortune,
immortality,
divine
impulse
of
human
beings,
and
the
invocation
of
divine
power
or
help.
Ansuz
is
also
the
rune
of
communications.
It
rules
over
song,
poetry,
examinations,
interviews
and
magickal
incantations.
It
offers
convincing
and
magnetic
speech,
plus
the
power
of
suggestion
and
hypnosis.
Use
Ansuz
to
gain
wisdom,
confidence
and
luck
with
exams,
increase
of
active
magickal
energies
(intensified
by
the
copper),
clairvoyant
abilities,
and
divine
communication.\r\n\r\n
The
copper
surface
has
been
left
in
a
natural
state,
though
it
can
easily
be
shined
with
baking
soda
or
Barkeepers
Friend
powder
on
a
moist
cotton
swab.
Always
spray
hairspray,
perfume,
or
body
spray
BEFORE
putting
on
any
jewelry,
to
avoid
build-up
and
damage.
Clean
after
wear
with
a
cotton
swab
dipped
in
rubbing
alcohol.
No
jewelry
should
be
worn
while
sleeping
or
bathing,
but
natural
copper,
especially,
will
not
wear
well
under
such
conditions.
If
you
know
your
body
has
a
tendency
to
quickly
&quot;green
up&quot;
or
oxidize
copper,
then
don&#39;t
wear
this
pendant
directly
against
the
skin;
hanging
outside
the
clothing
will
prevent
skin
discoloration
while
still
offering
the
health
and
metaphysical
benefits
of
this
metal.
Anti-tarnish
strips
are
helpful
for
storage,
but
with
good
general
sense
your
hand
crafted
jewelry
should
last
for
many
years
to
come.\r\n\r\n*

and
Conference
Center,
Perrysville,
Ohio.
For

info
please

Wanda
Clark
at

\r\n\r\nThe
color
combination
on
this
pie
bird
is
pink,
green
and
black.
I
think
it
worked
out
particularly
well.
Height
is
four
and
a
half
inches.
Shipping
weight
is
under
a
pound.
\r\n\r\nThe
clay
body
is
a
high
fire
Soldate
60.
I
form
each
of
my
pie
bird/vents
on
a
pottery
wheel.
Each
is
made
individually
and
they
vary
in
size
and
shape.
When
trimmed
and
decorated
they
take
on
their
own
personalities.
I
try
to
make
my
vents
a
useful
shape
with
a
wide
shoulder
to
support
the
crust.
Clear
glaze
is
low
fire
food
safe
and
lead

Vent
has
my

Spalted
Yellow
Birch
Picture
Frame
I
made
this
frame
from
scratch
in
my
home
wood
working
shop.
It
is
made
with
Spalted
(rotting
on
the
stump)
Yellow
Birch
Hardwood.
Each
spalted
frame
is
different
depending
on
the
rot
and
how
far
along
it
is
while
still
remaining
healthy
enough
to
make
a
frame).\r\nThis
is
a
3
toned
naturally
beautiful
frame
that
I
cut
from
the
woods
in
Maine,
after
which
I
sawed
out
and
kiln
dried
the
wood.
Then
I
hand
chose
the
beautiful
Pieces
of
wood
that
I
thought
would
go
nicely
in
a
frame.
After
I
plane
down
the
pieces
of
wood
and
cut
them
to
fit
in
a
frame,
I
glue,
clamp
and
then
V-Nail
the
back
corners
for
extra
good
holding.
I
sand
the
frame
more
and
then
I
coat
it
with
Seal-A-Cell
and
then
3
coats
of
Arm-R-Seal(oil
&
poly).
This
finish
is
semi
gloss
and
will
clean
with
normal
furniture
cleaner.
I
have
hand
stamped
the
back
of
each
frame
to
show
it
is
hand
made
by
me
in
my
Athens
Maine
shop.\r\nThis
frame
is
11
X
14
and
will
hold
an
11
X
14
picture
or
an
11
X
14
matte
that
can
hold
a
collage
or
a
smaller
photo.
Buyer
can
mount
art
or
photos
in
this
frame.\r\nI
can
put
a
Saw
tooth
hanger
on
the
back
of
the
frame
if
you
state
which
you
want,
horizontal
or
vertical.
Or
I
can
enclose
it
in
shipping.
Buyer
is
going
to
need
to
buy
glass
(painted
art
is
not
displayed
behind
glass)
or
you
can
use
an
old
frame
glass
if
you
are
replacing
frames
in
your
home
or
work
place,
this
takes
a
standard
piece
of
11
X
14
glass.
Buyer
can
purchase
it
at
a
hardware
store
or
glass
cutting
store
inexpensively
and
save
on
shipping.\r\nI
hope
you
like
this
frame
and
you
can
look
for
similar
8
X
10
frames
in
my
shop
here
on
etsy.
I
also
sell
frames
with
my
own
photos
mounted
in
them,
so
if
this
interests
you
please
look
further
in
my

Apatite
Branches
My
pictures
dont
even
come
close
to
doing
this
pair
justice!!\r\n\r\n6
painstakingly
selected
mesmerizing
apatite
chips,
carefully
hand-wound
with
the
finest
sterling
silver
wire,
into
these
breath-takingly
beautiful
apatite
sprigs.
\r\n\r\nApatite
is
a
beautiful,
relatively
rare
gemstone,
boasting
the
most
beautiful
shades
of
sea-green
to
deep
pacific-blue.
(It
is
also
pretty
hard
to
work
with,
so
this
pair
took
me
quite
a
while
to
make.)\r\n\r\nApatite
is
thought
to
enhance
creativity,
self
expression,
effective
communication,
altruism,
and
ease
stress
and
tensions.
If
thats
not
your
thing,
just
imagine
how
wonderfully
these
amazing
blues,
greens
and
sparkling
sterling
silver
will
compliment
your
look!
\r\n\r\nThanks
for
looking!\r\n

Shibori
Charmeuse
Kimono
w\\\\/Back
Detail
Here
is
a
kimono
with
a
bit
of
a
twist
-
it
has
front
pockets,
a
back
pleat,
Chinese
ball
buttons,
and
braiding.
I
know
you
will
just
look
fantastic
in
it
as
a
cover
up
over
your
skimpy,
little
black
dress,
or
those
wide
legged
black
pants.
\r\n\r\nThe
kimono
is
30&quot;
in
length,
made
from
silk
charmeuse
(silk
satin),
dyed
with
French
dyes,
steam
set
and
then
sewn.
Silk
crepe
de
chine
outlines
the
sleeves
and
makes
up
the
collar.
Front
pockets
are
9&quot;
in
width,
with
a
depth
of
almost
5&quot;.
As
you
can
see
from
the
close
up
photo,
the
back
has
a
horizontal
pleat
beneath
the
three
Chinese
ball
button,
and
a
center
back
pleat.
The
braiding
winds
its
way
across
the
back
from
side
pocket
to
side
pocket.
This
is
a
ONE
OF
A
KIND
KIMONO,
never
to
be
repeated,
so
I
suggest
you
buy
this
while
its
still
available,
as
there
will
absolutely
be
no
others
like
it.
\r\n\r\nSized
to
comfortably
fit
the
medium
and
large
figure,
please
dry
clean
only.

Space
Invaders
Necklace
This
is
the
full
set
of
three
Space
Invaders
necklaces
at
a
bit
of
a
discount
(normally
$15
each).
These
necklaces
are
made
using
the
same
process
that
I
use
to
make
my
cutting
boards,
and
are
essentially
made
of
between
120
and
150
little
tiny
cubes
of
walnut
and
maple
hardwood
(ok,
so
they
aren&#39;t
quite
as
hard
to
make
as
they
sound,
but
trust
me,
they
take
a
lot
of
time).
I
finish
the
necklaces
with
6
coats
of
lacquer
so
they
really
shine.
The
Invaders
measure
roughly
1
3\\\\/8&quot;
X
1
1\\\\/8&quot;
by
1\\\\/8&quot;
thick
(there
is
a
bit
of
variation
from
one
to
the
next,
but
hey,
they&#39;re
handmade).
My
girlfriend
tells
me
these
are
super-cute,
and
you
can
definitely
trust
her
as
a
completely
unbiased
party
in
this
case.

Lampwork
Bead
Earrings
Anything
But
Ordinary
These
are
handmade
earrings,
but
I
did
not
make
the
two
lampwork
lentil
beads.
I
found
them
at
a
local
bead
store
and
they
were
mine
the
minute
I
saw
them.
\r\n\r\nEach
side
of
the
lentil
bead
is
unique.
The
earhooks
are
24kt
gold
plated.
The
earrings
are
topped
off
with
24kt
vermeil
daisy
spacers,
a
swarovski
topaz
bicone
bead,the
georgeous
lentil
bead
and
at
the
very
botom
is
a
gold
charlotte
cut
bead.\r\n\r\nI
am
proud
of
these
earrings.
I
hope
someone
out
there
in
cyberspace
might
love
them
too.
They
measure
one
and
one-half
inches
from
the
top
curve
of
the
earwires
to
the
bottom
bead.
\r\n\r\n\r\nThey
were
made
in
my
smokefree
but
dog
and
cat
friendly
home.

Pendant
This
pendant
is
made
from
a
silkworm&#39;s
golden
cocoon
and
a
freshwater
pearl
in
a

The
cocoon
is
its
natural

and
was
harvested

had
shed
it.
The

Fluffy
Mother
Pie
Bird
by
Bonnie
Dean
There
will
be
a
pie
bird
collector
convention
June
25-27,
2010
at
the
Mohican
Resort
and
Conference
Center,
Perrysville,
Ohio.
For
more
info
please
contact
Wanda
Clark
at
clarkcw@gvtc.com
\r\n\r\nThis
fluffy
bird
needs
to
clean
her
toe
nails.
I
distorted
the
shape
to
give
her
a
sitting
on
eggs
look.
This
is
one
of
my
first
birds.
I
was
working
with
a
limited
pallet:
Yellow,
white,
black
and
brown.
The
pie
bird
is
3
1/4
inches
tall.
\r\n\r\nShe
has
a
useful
shape
to
support
the
crust
on
her
shoulders
or
on
her
face.
The
decoration
is
folk
art
fun.
The
clay
body
is
Mesa
Red.
I
form
each
of
my
pie
bird/vents
on
a
pottery
wheel.
Each
is
made
individually
and
they
vary
in
size
and
shape.
When
trimmed
and
decorated
they
take
on
their
own
personalities.
Clear
high
gloss
glaze
is
food
safe
and
lead
free.
Each
has
my
mark
(a
bumblebee
over
a
capital
D)
stamped
inside.
They
all
come
with
a
certificate
of
authenticity
with
their
picture,
number
and
species.
The
number
represents
their
order
of
creation.
My
early
pie
birds
are
included
in
volume
2
of
Linda
Fields,
Four
and
Twenty
Blackbirds
price
guide.\r\n
\r\nIf
more
than
one
pie
bird
is
ordered
at
the
same
time
I
will
ship
them
together
and
I
will
pay
any
additional
shipping
cost.
\r\n\r\nMy
personal
return
policy
is
if
you
don’t
like
it
return
it
in
7
days
for
a
full
refund
including
postage.\r\n\r\n

Vintage
Scarf
signed
Ginnie
Johansen
This
is
a
gorgeous
patterned
scarf
by
Ginnie
Johansen
with
a
copyright
on
the
tag
for
1989.
\r\n\r\nIt
is
100%
silk
and
made
in
Japan.
I
washed
and
dried
it
and
it
looks
great.
Hemmed
all
around
and
in
excellent
condition.
\r\n\r\nThe
design
is
pretty
spectacular
and
one
side
has
very
nice
gold
details.
\r\n\r\nThis
would
make
a
very
cool
halter
top
with
the
addition
of
a
thick
gold
chain
to
stitch
a
corner
over.
It&#39;s
also
big
enough
to
tie
on.
I
have
also
seen
these
made
into
some
pretty
couch
pillows.
\r\n\r\nSize:
around
26&quot;
by
26&quot;
square
and
41&quot;
long
on
the
diagonal.

doesn&#39;t.\r\n\r\nThis
holder
measures
about

and
would

in
the
mail
with
a
first

for
co-workers,

friends,
or
family.\r\n\r\n******************\r\n\r\nA

recommends

as
an
attractive
way
to
give
gift
cards.
A
traditional
gift
card
holder
has
only
one
use,
but
this
holder
can
be
used
long
after
the
gift
card
has
been
redeemed!\r\n\r\n*******************\r\n\r\n\r\n*
