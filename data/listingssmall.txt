95869	edit	17910	Emerald Deity-Zodiac-Emerald -14K GOLD -Jewelry-CHARGED, Natural, Clear Phantom QUARTZ Crystal Point PENDANT -Vedic Talisman with- Business Astrology	ABOUT EMERALD DEITY 1: \r\n\r\nThis is an ENERGIZED HOLISTIC TOOL, consisting of a genuine, quality emerald set in 14K solid gold over a natural clear phantom QUARTZ crystal.  The crystal is a rare beauty, with a pyramid phantom tucked right beneath the gold setting.  The setting allows light to go through the emerald for greater brightness and reflection. \r\n\r\nThis crytal has multiple uses and can be worn for energy balancing, or used for healing, meditation, reiki, radionics, and other holistic uses.\r\n\r\nEmerald is associated in the Vedic system with the planet Mercury. Mercury is associated with communications, among many other things. The Vedas are probably the oldest knowledge in the world and they encompass all walks of life and areas of human knowledge.  Vedic knowledge is at the foundation of modern Hinduism and if not the foundation, then a great influence on other religions as well, including Buddhism.\r\n\r\nTHE UNIQUE NATURE OF THIS ITEM:\r\n\r\nThis item has Multiple Functions: Ceremonial Tool, Holistic Transceiver, Talisman, Amulet and Pendant. It is a unique combination of a precious gem, a very nice quality emerald, and an unusual, beautifully clear phantom quartz crystal point with a perfectly shaped pyramid phantom in the center. It is set in thick, 14K, solid gold. \r\n\r\nThis item is a holistic tool designed so that it could be worn as a talisman, amulet and pendant, if desired.\r\n\r\nNone of the items listed in this site were items originally prepared for sale to the public. They are part of a private collection. They are not mass-produced.
