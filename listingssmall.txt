95869	edit	17910	Emerald Deity-Zodiac-Emerald -14K GOLD -Jewelry-CHARGED, Natural, Clear Phantom QUARTZ Crystal Point PENDANT -Vedic Talisman with- Business Astrology	ABOUT EMERALD DEITY 1: \r\n\r\nThis is an ENERGIZED HOLISTIC TOOL, consisting of a genuine, quality emerald set in 14K solid gold over a natural clear phantom QUARTZ crystal.  The crystal is a rare beauty, with a pyramid phantom tucked right beneath the gold setting.  The setting allows light to go through the emerald for greater brightness and reflection. \r\n\r\nThis crytal has multiple uses and can be worn for energy balancing, or used for healing, meditation, reiki, radionics, and other holistic uses.\r\n\r\nEmerald is associated in the Vedic system with the planet Mercury. Mercury is associated with communications, among many other things. The Vedas are probably the oldest knowledge in the world and they encompass all walks of life and areas of human knowledge.  Vedic knowledge is at the foundation of modern Hinduism and if not the foundation, then a great influence on other religions as well, including Buddhism.\r\n\r\nTHE UNIQUE NATURE OF THIS ITEM:\r\n\r\nThis item has Multiple Functions: Ceremonial Tool, Holistic Transceiver, Talisman, Amulet and Pendant. It is a unique combination of a precious gem, a very nice quality emerald, and an unusual, beautifully clear phantom quartz crystal point with a perfectly shaped pyramid phantom in the center. It is set in thick, 14K, solid gold. \r\n\r\nThis item is a holistic tool designed so that it could be worn as a talisman, amulet and pendant, if desired.\r\n\r\nNone of the items listed in this site were items originally prepared for sale to the public.

192189	active	40064	Fall of Atlantis gothic fantasy art print by Jasmine Becket-Griffith 8x10	***Details: \r\n\r\nA beautiful 8&quot;x10&quot; fine art fantasy print!    This is a professional print made from my original acrylic painting, and is on glossy photo paper. The print measures 8.5&quot;x11&quot; including a white mounting border for ease of matting, framing, or just hanging by itself!  It will fit a standard 8&quot;x10&quot; frame.  I would be happy to sign or personalize your print, front or back at your request =) It has a great deal of detail in it, and it is far lovelier in real life than in the low-quality scan.  The copyright watermark is just for the auction, itâs not in the actual print!  It may have been cropped or discoloured slightly by my scanner.  I hope you enjoy looking at it, and maybe even adding it to your collection. It has a great deal of detail in it, and the colours are considerably brighter in real life than in the low-quality scan.  You are bidding on beautiful fine art print by fantasy artist Jasmine Becket-Griffith (aka Strangeling). \r\n\r\n***About the Artist:\r\n\r\nMy name is Jasmine Becket-Griffith.  I am 26 years old and I live in beautiful Celebration, Florida.  I am a full-time artist and I make my living selling my artwork.  I have been selling my original Fairy, Gothic, and Fantasy artwork online for about 8 years now.  I am a self-representing artist, and you are purchasing this artwork directly from me, the artist.  I feel that it is important for me to sell my work directly to my fans, without the needless expenses or pretension of a gallery or middleman.    \r\n\r\nI grow weary of the mundane world, and I am trying to slowly create my own through my fantasy artwork.  I believe that with each piece of art I get out of my system, onto paper, and into your home I have done my part to make this place a more magical planet.  \r\n\r\nYou may have seen my artwork featured in new lines of clothing and other merchandise being sold in thousands of retail stores across the country, in places like Hot Topic, Torrid, etc.  Some of the paintings & prints that I am selling here on etsy are the very images that will be licensed for these products. Here is your chance to own the actual artwork!\r\n\r\nMy work can be found in collections and galleries throughout the world, and am featured in the books &quot;The Art of Faery&quot; & &quot;The World of Faery&quot; now in stores! I was also selected to have my artwork appear in &quot;Spectrum 11&quot; and the new &quot;Spectrum 13&quot;! Also be sure to check out my solo art book called &quot;Fairy: the Art of Jasmine Becket-Griffith&quot; now available. \r\n\r\n***Copyright Information:\r\n\r\nAll images and other content Copyright Â© by Jasmine Becket-Griffith.

She has a lampworked glass head, lots of Czech glass beads, silver hands, shoes, & body parts, all hung on a vintage silver bow pin. She is between about 4&quot; and 4 1/2&quot; depending on her position.\r\n\r\nThey shimmy. They shake. They wiggle. They dance. They make people smile.  They’re the BDs, fresh from the hands & brain of Leslie Sirag, whose art crafts have been exhibited in shows & galleries from New York to California.  Now working from her home in Washington State, Leslie produces these little charmers one at a time & each is an individual character who will never be duplicated, although the nature of the materials does mean that some pieces will be similar. \r\n\r\nMost of the BDs, like this one, are pins, though some are bookmarks or magnets. (All but the magnets can easily be converted to pendants if desired.) They can be worn, hang outside a book, or decorate a refrigerator,  but can also easily hang from curtains, lampshades, metal file cabinets, or anything else metal or with a knob or clip.  They range in height from about 4 to 6 inches.  \r\n\r\nThanks for joining us on The Creative Block.

The title was “The Little Flowers.”  The diminutive book caught my eye and I immediately became captivated by it.  It was enormously powerful for such a little thing!\r\n\r\nLeaving through its delicate onionskin pages, I came to realize that it was a book written by Francis of Assisi.  I knew nothing about Francis, but on reading the book I felt an immediate kinship.  All my life I’ve loved animals.  When I was 12, chipmunks used to eat out of my hands.  My cat Oreo and my dog Hooligan both curl up on my lap every night, and my ferret Jillian is my “littlest girlfriend.”\r\n\r\nAnyway, the inspiration for this ring is St. Francis, who was an extraordinarily humble soul and whom I want to emulate.  I hope some of the joy I felt making this ring infuses with gentleness and peace the person who chooses to own it.\r\n	1256585683000	1267212883000	1172286110000	1267299361000	25.0	USD	1	jewelry.ring.glass.metal.francis	silver.glass	0	null	25	6371065	1267299361000	1.26729933E9	23	20	f

Kept going to visit it, just looking and soaking in the ambiance, never measuring; one day set out to create my own version to convert into a purse.  So from memory drew up a pattern and made it up in wool.  Took that first one into the Antique Mall and Yahoo! had come pretty close. Enjoyed that first bag so much have made others from time to time.  This being one.  * And eventually did buy the original and keep it for display and as a great memory of how inspiration can hit.\r\n\r\n---------\r\n\r\nQuestions welcome, am happy to provide more detail if desired.\r\n\r\nAlso happy to send to places besides those listed.

Through 35 years of ups and downs art has been the one constant in my life. \r\nMy professional Art career began in March 1991 shortly after the birth of my second son. My hope was to earn the part time paycheck I needed to be a stay at home mom. Fourteen years later, Ive sold many drawings and paintings and thousands of prints all over the world! Thanks to all the wonderful people who have supported and purchased my art, my dream has become a reality! When I began 14 years ago, all sales happened on the road, there was no internet to connect me to the world. Although I still show in Galleries and sell prints in shops, most of my sales happen online. Welcome to the future! The best benefit to this outlet is that I get the privilege of dealing directly with the people who hang my art on their walls! \r\nI live in Albuquerque, New Mexico only a couple hours from my hometown, Las Cruces. I live with my husband Aaron, youngest son Nate and three dogs in a great house about half a mile from the Rio Grande River. Youll find us walking along the Bosque (area of trees around the river) most sunny afternoons. I spend my days (and some nights) working in my home studio, connected to the world by internet. I am also an active member of the Albuquerque artist community. In 2004 I co-founded Seventh Mountain Artists, a group of Albuquerque artists that originally met as art studio tenants at the Harwood Art Center. \r\nI currently work mainly in watercolor, but I have worked with a variety of mediums. I like to paint a fairly large variety of subject matter but stick mainly to southwest landscapes, portraits and my newest fascination, abstract expressionism! Recently, my main theme has been peace. I hope to make my mark on the world by spreading my message of Peace on Earth. I truly believe if everyone did their part, it could be a peaceful world for our children and grandchildren.	1276888449000	1287374400000	1173804331000	1276888552000	15.0	USD	1	art.print.ink.paper.green.red.yellow.zia.spiral.signed.matted.reproduction.open_edition.giclee	paper.print.matted	5959743	null	6	6647913	1276888552000	1.27688858E9	12	51	f

5574769	removed	5078118	Yesterday Tomorrow and Today Life Journeys Tag Hanging	“A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step.” \r\nConfucius – philosopher \r\n\r\npaperplanet Life Journeys are handcrafted using 2 – 5 recycled luggage tags. \r\nEach tag measures 2&quot; x 3 ¾&quot;. \r\nBoth sides of each tag are covered with different and unique handmade or imported papers.\r\n\r\nThe quote on this Life Journeys Tag Hanging is \r\n“Yesterday is history, tomorrow is a mystery, today is a present”.\r\n\r\nEach luggage tag is embellished with a variety of pressed naturals such as flowers, petals, leaves, greenery, and small roots. Some tags may include small images, vintage postage stamps, fibers, charms (such as angels, keys, butterflies), feathers, metal nail heads, or Chinese coins.\r\n\r\nAll Life Journeys include at least one tag with a circular opening or ‘window’. \r\nInside the opening may be a pressed flower or an image that has been mounted on handmade paper, a bit of lace or tulle, paper lace, Egyptian papyrus. \r\nLuggage tags may include gold or silver leafing, gold or silver lettering, or tiny faceted jewels.\r\n\r\nOne word or a few words included on each tag impart a short poem, quotation, inspiration, or sentiment when tags are read from top to bottom. \r\nTags are joined together with metallic cords, ribbons, or fibers. Glass, metal, or wooden beads threaded on the cords separate each tag. The joined tags are suspended from a 5’ rustic branch, thin bamboo, rolled bark or husk, or a smooth wooden rod. A loop of cord, ribbon, or fiber at the top allows for easy hanging.\r\n\r\nLife Journeys are lightweight and ready to hang against a wall or free flowing so that the tags turn in the slightest air current. Though both sides of each tag are embellished differently, the sentiment is always the same.\r\n\r\nSize - approximately 13” long not including hanging ribbon \r\n                              \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n	1174171159000	1184711959000	1174171159000	1279163603000	15.0	USD	1	art.mobile.handmade_papers.paper_goods.decorative.plants_and_edibles.housewares	recycledluggagetags.handmadepapers.pressedflowers.leaves.greenery.beads.rhinestones.metalliccords.ribbon.fibers.thinbranch.vintagetypewriter	0	null	36	6734828	1279163603000	1.18479872E9	null	null	null

5838389	sold_out	5119518	Ebony Rosary	These black barrel beads made one of the nicest rosaries I&#39;ve made.  This would make a nice gift for anyone on your holiday list.  The rosary beads are connected end to end by individual wires I cut and shape; the centuries are separated by five chain links.  I used a hypoallergenic silvertone wire inside the five sections.  The crucifix and Hail Mary Beads are imported from Italy.  The &quot;Holy Mother&quot; center is a relief of the Holy Mother holding Baby Jesus. On the reverse side is a relief of our risen Christ. It is a special hand-crafted charm that adds a lot of elegance with the natural beauty of the shiny black beads. The silver crucifix is also imported from Italy and is strikingly beautiful in its simplicity.  The nails are shown on the back side of the cross.  There is a lot of emotion showing in this rosary that gives it a lot of character. I hope you enyoy this special work of art. \r\n\r\nRosaries are not jewelry.  This has not been blessed, but it was created from a faithful heart. 	1270340657000	1280881457000	1177629691000	1274628993000	15.0	USD	1	jewelry.rosary.bead.wire.spiritual.catholic.imported_charms.italian.worship.prayer.crucifix.holy_mother.religious	black_barrel_shaped_beads.charm.crucifix.silver_chain_and_wire	5085297	null	11	94991689	1274628993000	1.27462899E9	0	100	f

They could be an excellent addition to your next sewing or craft project. Some of my buttons up for sale might be just what you are looking for to add to your latest scrapbooking project or to add the finishing touches to your new handmade clothing item. You could even revive an old piece of clothing with these new decorations.\r\n\r\n\r\nThese buttons are sold &quot;as-is&quot; so please take a look at the photographs. These buttons each have two holes. These buttons are each slightly different because of their handmade quality but are roughly 2.1 cm wide and 1.7 cm tall.\r\n\r\nCARE - I would only recommend a gentle hand-wash of any garments that have these buttons attached.\r\nThese buttons are not glazed.\r\nThe Sculpey website says - &quot;Polymer clay buttons (unless first coated with water resistant epoxy glazes) should not be washed in a conventional washer or dried in a dryer. If you do elect to wash the garment with the buttons remaining, turn the garment inside out, and wash on a gentle cycle or, preferably, by hand. Do not dry clean polymer clay buttons.&quot;\r\n\r\nThe polymer clay used to make these is non-toxic.\r\n\r\nPlease feel free to email me with any questions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKind regards,\r\n\r\nGeorgia\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------\r\nPostage information -\r\n\r\nI am located in Australia.\r\n\r\nPostage rates below are for parcel-sized packages as suitable bubble-wrapping is required for protection.\r\n\r\n\r\nOTHER COUNTRIES\r\nPlease email me for postage to other countries.\r\n\r\nCOMBINED POSTAGE\r\nI am happy to combine multiple purchases to save on shipping costs.

I&#39;m not an overly religious person, certainly not a &quot;pusher&quot;, but since I was young I&#39;ve said this particular rambling compilation of prayers superstitiously before falling asleep.  After I wrote the words out, I removed the masking fluid and worked on the painting from there.  \r\n\r\nThe result is a spiritual and bright painting with lots of imbued meaning.  Whether you choose your art to match your sofa or choose your art for its meaning, this is a beautiful and significant piece of artwork.  The colors are lighter and brighter in person.\r\n\r\nTECHNICAL DETAILS:\r\nThis is an original watercolor painting by Kate E. Austin, painted in 2006 on Arches 140 lb. bright white cold press watercolor paper with professional-grade watercolor paints. I&#39;m working on measuring all my pieces and will gladly provide this info in a convo - though I plan on updating this description soon.

6170469	sold_out	5143000	Space Cleansing Shamanic Distance Ceremony	Many people have asked me for assistance with various conditions and circumstances impacting their lives. More often than not the intensity of the energy of those conditions and circumstances require a level of energy not available among the current options in my etsy shop. \r\n\r\nSince I began my walk on the Path of the Shaman an important component of my work has been distance ceremonies. I have hesitated to include distance ceremony in my etsy shop; I thought it too commercial, and inappropriate. However, I have changed my mind on this due to contact with clients through my etsy shop, and after consultation with the Spirits of the Yachaqs (Shamans) of Imbabura. \r\n\r\nDistance Space Cleansing Ceremony\r\n\r\nThe Space Cleansing Ceremony is essentially a Shamanic Cleansing Ceremony for an environment, such as a house, office, apartment or landscape. Space Cleansing entails the identification of Spirit entities within an environment, and the subsequent removal of energies having an adverse effect on the environment and the people within it. Unwanted energies might be one or more of the following: an autonomous, yet parasitic, Spirit entity; a disembodied Spirit; or the energetic residue from powerful, traumatic experiences of the present-day inhabitants. The adverse effects of the unwanted energies may include, but are not limited to: recurring health problems, feelings of intense unease, relationship difficulties, or an overall sense of debilitation and loss of vitality.\r\n\r\nIn the Space Cleansing Ceremony I call on the Spirits of the Sacred Mountains, the 7 Sacred Spirits and Pachamama for guidance. Working through me, these Ancient Healing Spirits release all energetic entities producing negative influences on the current residents of the space.\r\n\r\nI look forward to working with you.\r\n\r\nTom Arcuti\r\nYachaq Shaman of Imbabura	1276602027000	1287115200000	1181534429000	1279006468000	180.0	USD	1	everything_else.custom.personalized.weird.magic.shaman.medicine.spirit.energy.space.cleansing.ceremony.metaphysical.new_age	null	5479959	15	17	28927072	1279006468000	1.27900646E9	0	100	f

He had what is commonly known as &quot;happy tail&quot; where he wagged it so much in his new forever home that he kept injuring it until it had to be made shorter.  This wooliture is made 100% of wool in its natural colors except for the collar I made.  I will make your own greyhound in any pose or coloring for you from photos\\\\/descriptions you send me.  \r\n\r\nThis is the medium size and they range from 4&quot;-6&quot;.  No two are alike.  I make them by needle felting.  They are soft, warm, light and unbreakable, like our pets!\r\n\r\nEach sculptural artwork is completely unique and personal for you.  These can not be reproduced unless I go through the entire process from the start and they will never be exactly alike.  So, your wooliture will be very special and unique.\r\n\r\nEach custom wooliture takes me from 3-6 weeks to create.  I love to add details and capture personalities in this artwork that should bring you happiness for the rest of your life.\r\n\r\nDue to a customer who received their custom wooliture, loved it and then did not pay the remainder due or return their wooliture or respond to any communication, so we could work a payment arrangement out, I will no longer be able to offer a 50% down payment up front.  I had many trustworthy customers who paid for the work I did for them.  Thank you to all of you!  I appreciate the majority of honest people.  I’m truly sorry that I have to change my policy now. \r\n\r\nPayment in full is expected at the time of the order.  When you receive your wooliture, if you are not satisfied, return your wooliture in good condition within 5-7 business days and you will be refunded 50% of the price.   I have never had any returned for repairs in all the years I have been making these. I just offer that as an assurance with this newish art form.\r\n\r\nSecure payment can be made at www.paypal.com to email address RoseThistleRanch@aol.com.\r\n\r\nShipping is FREE.  \r\n\r\nI also offer a lifetime warrantee.  Should the need for repairs arise, you just send it back to me and I will repair it for free for life.  Although, I&#39;ve never had any returned for repairs in all the years I&#39;ve been making these.  Since I densely felt, they are very sturdy.  But, I offer this for your peace of mind with this new art form.\r\n\r\nNeedlefelt sculpting was only discovered in the 1980&#39;s.  This is a very new technique and the cutting edge of the art world.  I just love to create personal pet portraits for people using this technique!  It&#39;s very easy to learn and I strongly suggest you do a search on etsy for &quot;needlefelt kits&quot; if you have an inkling to try it out.\r\n\r\nI will also make any other breed of dog or any other animal type you would like.

6449069	active	27229	Yer Basic Hot Pink Pouch Baby Sling, Size 1	Most all of my &quot;Sized To You&quot; sling fabrics can be made into lovey blankets or a diaper & wipe clutch to match your sling, just ask!\r\n\r\nThis fabric is 97% cotton and 3% spandex, is machine washable (cold wash, tumble dry) and pre-shrunk. There is one-way stretch to this fabric, and I sew the sling so there&#39;s some stretch vertically. This means the sling is less likely to sag with the weight of your child, but he or she will have a little wiggle room. The pouch seam is triple reinforced; many people carry their babies from birth up to 35 pounds or more. Inspect your sling regularly to ensure good condition; I choose high-quality fabrics and take care with sewing them, but please be responsible when using a sling. \r\n\r\nThis sling is a size 1. To figure out which size to buy, please take a soft measuring tape or long scarf and loosely measure (not too loose, not too tight) the distance from the outer part of your shoulder to your opposite hip, about level with where your baby&#39;s bum sits when you&#39;re holding him or her on your hip (sans sling!).  See picture above for how to measure.  Then, find your size on the following chart:\r\n\r\nSize 0: 22.5-23 inches\r\nSize 1: 23.5-24 inches\r\nSize 2: 24.5-25 inches \r\nSize 3: 25.5-26 inches \r\nSize 4: 26.6-27 inches\r\nSize 5: 27.5-28 inches\r\nSize 6: 28.5-29 inches\r\n\r\nAs a reference point, a size 3 sling is what I would call a “medium” – i.e. for a woman of average height and average bust size.  Sling sizing is an inexact science at best!  If you are tall or busty or broad-shouldered, you’ll likely be on the higher end of the sizing chart.  If you need help figuring out what size to buy, please contact me, as I am happy to help!  If you need a size larger than 6, that’s fine too, just let me know.\r\n\r\nI sew these slings myself while my boy naps or plays nearby; I am proud of my work, I am a strong proponent of babywearing, and I want you to be happy with your purchase! Please contact me if you have more questions regarding my slings. We have a smoke-free home.\r\n\r\nI accept returns of slings in their original condition. My return policy is to work with you to make it right; if it is a sizing problem and I have more of the fabric, I will make another sling for you or refund the purchase price. \r\n\r\nThank you for looking, and please take a moment to check out my other slings, or contact me and we&#39;ll design one for you, together!\r\n	1277947558000	1288411200000	1184432425000	1277947558000	10.0	USD	2	children.baby.toddler.sling.pouch.babywearing.carrier.sateen.cotton.stretch.baby_shower.gift.pink.hot_pink	cotton.thread.love	5024840	null	12	21559372	1277947558000	1.27794752E9	97	74	f

6511229	active	5211155	YOUR HEARTS DESIRE - Artisan rainbow heart furnace slices, crystal sterling silver, heart link chain, heart toggles, necklace converts to a bracelet and ankle bracelet.	Was $75.00\r\n\r\nAnd now for something completely different.....Red based, heart shaped rainbow furnace slices are wire wrapped to form the links of this versatile piece.  Loads of sparkle and flash from the accent crystals and seed beads.  Finished with a heart shaped toggle.  The ankle bracelet is created from heart link chain, matching furnace bead and matching heart toggle.  When the toggles of the 2 pieces are joined they form an approx. 18&quot; necklace.\r\nThe bracelet will fit up to a 7&quot; wrist.\r\nThe ankle bracelet will fit up to 9.25&quot; ankle\r\n(The math doesn&#39;t seem to add up but when the pieces are joined rather then placed around something like, let&#39;s say a wrist you actually gain some length.  Who&#39;d guess?) In the photos I&#39;ve included a heart slice to make it easier to see the shape and color of the beads.\r\n\r\nAll metal is solid sterling silver.  A great gift idea for someone special.  How about yourself?\r\n\r\n\r\n*A little info on the focal beads featured in my jewelry. The lampwork/boro are the creations of some of USA’s finest glass artists and the furnace beads are primarily from David Christensen, Carrie Matthews, Glass Art Works and Mingo and Asho. US furnace beads have much greater detail and richness of color then the usually seen imports. All the lampwork beads have been properly kiln annealed.\r\n\r\n	1270476876000	1281017676000	1184978721000	1273779648000	50.0	USD	1	jewelry.bracelet.necklace.rainbow.crystal.converts.furnace_beads.sterling_silver.reds.heart_shaped_beads.sundaezchild.trade	lampwork.boro.borosilicate.furnace.beads.sterling.silver.glass.bali.swarovski.crystal	5135426	null	1	12774098	1273779648000	1.27377971E9	34	56	f
6521169	edit	5176477	SOFTEST SUNRISE	EVE&#39;S GARDEN:  ALWAYS EXCLUSIVE; ALWAYS 100% SATISFACTION GUARANTEED OR YOUR INVESTMENT CHEERFULLY REFUNDED\r\n\r\nOh, how these pics failed me!  These beautiful double-strand beads are deceptively sparkly...just so soft and serene, but with a glitter that&#39;s just mesmerizing.  The base of the longer (approximately 19&quot;) strand of beads is in the purest, most elegant powder pink, with a softly swirling ocean blue and touches of dreamy aqua.  Overlaying this elegant color combo are soft little accent dots of the gentlest cashmere tan.  Between these miniature works of art are a beautiful array of Swarovski pearls and crystals, including the awesome shade of Rose Water Opal, a luminescent opaque shell pink that seems to just glow from within.  The shorter strand echoes the pattern of the longer one, but is gentler in its approach.  Some of the smaller donut crystal beads are opaque, some are solid in color; both are decorated with swirls and dots of the cashmere tan found in the larger beads.  Between each smaller lampwork bead is a lovely 8mm Swarovski Rose Water Opal crystal, cushioned on either side by tiny 4mm Swaroski crystals first in Powder Pink, then Golden Shadow, then Powder Pink again.  The matching French wire earrings are perfect complements to the necklace.  This set is sublimely comfortable to wear, with the button beads laying smoothly on the skin.  Another beautiful EVE&#39;S GARDEN EXCLUSIVE. \r\n\r\n LAMPWORK: Lampwork... the exquisite, exacting art of creating glass beads by hand, one at a time, melting colored glass rods by torch and applying layer after layer of color, mixing and swirling the patterns, adding precious metals like gold and silver leaf and sparkling dichroic treatments...each finished bead a unique, one-of-a-kind work of art. \r\n\r\n____________________________________________\r\n\r\n	1270481709000	1281022509000	1185083768000	1278434756000	75.0	USD	1	jewelry.necklace.bead.lampwork.crystal.swarovski.earrings	lampwork.crystal.pearls.goldfilled	0	27	1	24089770	1278434756000	1.27843482E9	0	100	f

6597049	sold_out	5014365	Eibhear- Celtic Warrior from the Other Side	Traditional celtic folklore refers to the faeries as the &quot;Good People&quot; so as not to offend them. The good people are powerful tricksters and do not generally appear as our modern perception would have them- frail, cute, winged creatures; they are not to be taken lightly.\r\n\r\nEibhear is an elfin warrior of the mist. He is a protector to his loyal clansmembers, but care should be taken not to cross him.\r\n\r\nEibhear is a one-of-a-kind needle-sculped cloth doll. He is stuffed with polyfill and poly beads for weight. His &quot;skin&quot; has been painted over gesso and then protected with acrylic sealer. His hair and beard are made of wool, each &quot;dreaded&quot; strand meticulously applied. You may not be able to tell due to the lighting in the pics, but Eibhear has a purple caste to his skin and his hair is a plum colored wool. His myserious eyes are kelly-green. Eibhear is about 10 inches tall in the sitting position.\r\n\r\nHis plaid &quot;tartan&quot; shorts are made just for him and can be removed via the drawstring in the back. There is a small button attached to the front of his shorts.\r\n\r\nEibhear has two hand beaded necklaces- one is made of wooden beads and tiny seashells, the other is made of seed beads and has a tiny crystal.

I then drove around Detroit and took pictures of cityscapes where I found similar symbolic references.  I combined the images that I felt complimented each other, and then I incorporated decorative dot patterns where I created fanciful birds, flowers, and water, among other things, to convey hope and rebirth.  \r\n\r\nThis is a watercolor painting along with pen and ink on a high-quality hot pressed watercolor paper.\r\n\r\n It should be noted that the colors in this picture are not completely true to the original, and the original is brighter and the white is a true white--it is not muted.

Eisenhower added the words, “Under God”. The 23 words now comprise a 31 profession of loyalty and devotion to not only a flag, but to a way of life…the American ideal. My painting depicts community with… &quot;The Pledge of Allegiance&quot; on a scroll.\r\n\r\nThis is also of jewelry and greeting cards.\r\n \r\nI also do oil paintings by commission of photographs.\r\n\r\nThank you for stopping by and have a beautiful day. \r\n\r\nMarilyn of Art By Marilyn	1271887598000	1282428398000	1186537664000	1280295791000	16.0	USD	1	art.painting.oil.pledge.of_allegiance.red_white_blue.one_nation.under_god.prints.various_sizes.greeting_cards.jewelry.pendant.team_efa	canvas.board.oil.paint.pencil.idea.sketch.brushes	5167286	234	1	10220922	1230271936000	1.27188762E9	23	57	f

The classic design makes it suitable for casual, business or evening wear.   Bracelet measures approx. 7.5 inches and features a gold tone toggle clasp.   \r\n\r\nI&#39;ve been addicted to collecting vintage buttons for years!  Over time I&#39;ve started turning some of them into jewelry pieces.  Most of the buttons used are between 40-90 years old though occasionally, suce as with this piece, I will use a contemporary button.

No, there really is no telling when it will until it does.  If your ring breaks and it&#39;s the absolutely most wonderful ring you&#39;ve ever had and you can&#39;t go on without it, email or call me before you send it back to me, please!

The first is the decorative and unusual look of the stitching on the spine. The second is that it can be opened fully at any point within the book without distorting the pages. In a Case Bound book (like most books available), the pages are bent because of the inflexibility of the spine. Coptic bound books always open flat and easy to work in!\r\n\r\nThese books look delicate, but are very durable. They stand up better to mixed media techniques than case bound books in my own artwork. The waxed linen thread makes for a very strong and flexible spine.

The rough edges have been sanded off, but no wax or varnish has been used so she still retains the rustic look of an old handmade doll.  \r\n\r\nHer hair is also twine, embedded into her head and glued in place.  She wears a calico cotton pinafore with a matching bow in her hair.  Her hands are “spooned”.   \r\n\r\nShe would look great in a country style den or family room or would make a nice friend for a Raggedy or even a porcelain doll.   I made her to be displayed not as a toy, but even though she is not very cuddly, my six year old niece likes hers a lot.  \r\n\r\n The arms and legs can be untied so this is not a toy for a very young child.  \r\n	1270299084000	1280839884000	1192290277000	1278338378000	10.0	USD	1	woodworking.home_decor.doll.country	wood.twine.fabric	5194070	null	1	12592002	1278338378000	1.27833843E9	41	55	f

Then you will automatically have 8 nifty notes to use for whatever you desire.  How is that for recycling?\r\n\r\nAll digital photographs are printed on Fujicolor Crystal Archive paper and are checked for quality prior to shipment.

The embedded RAM chips symbolize computer language. Communication streams have rapidly evolved in the last 20 years into an expeditious, instantaneous form of contact through the cold, impersonal, abstract means of technology. The white, hand-written language goes in the opposite direction. Its forms are inspired by elegant, handwritten messages on postcards from the early 20th century.\r\n\r\nIt&#39;s in the representation of rhythmical delights that both subject matters geminate. Both forms feature repetition of shapes and forms found in the exact, rigid quadforms of the RAM and rhythmical delights of the elegant, ascenders and descenders of the handwriting. \r\n\r\nThe RAM and handwriting contrast and compare in various symbolic and formal ways, thus demonstrating the powerful range and capabilities of mankind to create language.\r\n\r\n+++ SIZE +++\r\n7.25&quot; wide x 10&quot; high x 1.5&quot; depth\r\n\r\n+++ MEDIUM +++\r\nRAM, screws, enamel paint on rescued wood\r\n\r\n+++ ORIGINAL +++\r\nThis is an original sculpture signed by the artist.\r\n\r\n+++ GUARANTEE +++\r\nThe artist has personally created and signed this sculpture so you are guaranteed the highest quality art.

Measuring 3\\\\/4&quot; wide by  1 1\\\\/8&quot; tall and 3\\\\/16&quot; thick, this mosaic pendant was painstakingly assembled one piece at a time and appears to be floating inside the  timeless designed greek key sterling silver bezel.

As our supplies of hulls vary, the hulls used in each light set may not look exactly as illustrated.\r\n\r\nThe light set is straight-line (plug at one end only).\r\n\r\nOverall length is approx 8&#39; (the overall length may not be exact to light set you receive as the length of light sets vary between each manufacturer and\\\\/or shipment).\r\n\r\nLight Set comes with two spare bulbs (one being a blinky\\\\/flasher bulb).\r\n\r\nLight Sets can be used throughout the year, for bar decorations or unique lighting effects in hunting, trophy or reloading rooms. The pictures don&#39;t do these justice, they look really sharp!\r\n\r\nOur Bar & Party light sets are carefully put together. We hand pick each hull, using only the cleanest hulls, no rusted ends here, and all the hulls match.\r\n\r\nIndividual lights are inserted into each hull by hand and carefully crimped closed, not held together with plastic cinch ties, glue or just flattened. This makes for a nice clean overall look.\r\n\r\nAdditional close-up picture used to show our attaching method was taken using a set of Winchester Bar & Party Lights.\r\n\r\nSHIPPING\r\n----------------\r\n\r\nSent by Small Packet Air\r\nInsurance: included\r\nTracking: not available\r\nDays in Transit: 8 to 12 business days\r\n\r\nA business day does not include day of mailing, weekends or holidays.\r\n\r\nTo offset the higher S&H cost on this item, we are including one 12 Ga Shotgun Shell Survival Key Chain ($7.50 value) for free (last picture shown).\r\n\r\nMULTIPLE PURCHASES\r\n-------------------------------------\r\n\r\nWe offer COMBINED SHIPPING. \r\n\r\nThe cost of S&H will be determined by what you purchase (the overall size and weight of the order). \r\n\r\nIf purchasing multiple items you may wait to send payment.

They are embellished with red Swarovski crystals and glass seed beads. These are easy to dress up or down. They are very feminine and dainty.\r\n\r\nThe thread is very fine cotton. \r\n\r\nThe earrings measure 2 1\\\\/4 inches from the top of the ear wire, and 1 inch across at the widest point. \r\n\r\n\r\nYour earrings are new and unworn.

Their\r\nspecial process creates components that have incredible brilliance and are in high demand. They cost a little more, but the results are worth it.\r\n\r\nWhat is tatting?\r\n\r\nTatting is an ancient art of making lace using a series of knots. This was done by the women in villages to make fishing nets and then developed into the art of lace making as the knots became finer and designs more sophisticated. This lace is extremely strong and will not unravel like knitting or crocheting.\r\n\r\nCare instructions are included with each lace purchase.\r\n\r\nThis would be easy to customize in any color you could wish.

7922429	active	5363991	Pit Bull Pin  CINNAMON	Cinnamon is a Old Family Red Nose American Pit Bull Terrier looking for a home and to pretty up any outfit (jacket, dress, purse, etc.). Cinnamon is a soft & wooly Conversation starter who, as with a TRUE pit bull, tough exterior with a mushy soft inside, is EXTREMELY people friendly.\r\n\r\nThe Old Family is a line of APBT that is red nosed, gold eyed and a piece of history. An exclusive line that claims to trace their lineage from a few red nosed dogs imported from Ireland and now registered with UKC and\\\\/or ADBA. As well as the color differences, the Old Family Reds have a bit longer nose, for the most part a more intense personality and conformation that holds up well over time. In other words, I found that they might not be the first dogs to champion in the conformation ring but they would champion against younger dogs when most of their original competition no longer had the figure to compete conformation or work wise. They stand the test of time and abuse of working (obedience, agility, hunting & farm).\r\n\r\nThe needle felted pin measures 3&quot; x 2 1\\\\/4&quot; with a golden eye and red nose like her name sake. Unlike a real adult dog, her new owner gets the choice of cropped ears (upright), prick (upright with tip over) or rose ears. \r\n\r\nSoft, wool sculpture portrait of your beloved animal made without the use of patterns or kits, this is truly a One of a Kind pin or magnet sculpture. I&#39;ve named the soft wool felt sculptures, &quot;Woolisons&quot; or &quot;-sons&quot;. These awesome handmade animal heads are felted very densely creating high end quality artwork and detailed to breed specifics by an artist that has shown in the breed ring and volunteers with multiple breeds and mixes every week. \r\n\r\nFor custom order portraits of your favorite pet or show animal, I will be working directly off of photographs that you supply, pictures must clearly show markings & profile of the animal. The description of the animal’s temperament helps clarify the vision of the animal not seen in pictures and allows the animal’s shape and personality to appear. A portion of the fiber for sculpture can be from your own animal&#39;s hair to make this a very special keepsake for you. Each pin will measure between 1&quot; - 2.25&quot; and because of the lightness of the wool it will be amazingly light. Please allow 2-3 weeks for completion from the date of payment.\r\n\r\nNeedle felting is the process of agitating washed wool roving with a wickedly sharp barb needle and sculpting it into shape. A special barbed needle to felt with and several different high quality fibers - Corridale, Merino, llama, alpaca, angora, mohair and other animal fibers to achieve the correct colors of each dog breed as much as possible. Each dog is made without the use of patterns or kits. The sculpting is done by poking the wool fibers thousands of times until they interlock and felt together and the artistry of the animal’s shape and personality appear. As with any art form, sometimes the “woolison” takes on a life of its own and leads the artist to its final beautiful sculpture that can not be exactly copied or mass produced, even by the artist. And believe me, I have tried to make the same animal twice and the wool wants to do what the wool wants to do, even with me poking it into submission. \r\n\r\nRemember the Needle Felted Dogs are for the adult collector and not toys. The edges amd back of the animal are fully felted and finished. Your choice of a gold metal pin attached with tight hand stitching using heavy 100% Cotton Hand Quilter&#39;s thread or a glued magnet, please request preference at time of order. If you desire to mount it in a shadow box the pin is removable.\r\n\r\nI do refund paid shipping\\\\/handling fees in excess of $1.00, will gift wrap and insure article if desired.

7932089	active	5169334	Hotlanta text rubber stamp	I am listing numerous rubber stamps from my huge stash of unloved (sometimes unused) stamps. I am selling each stamp for a fraction of its original price, plus shipping and handling. Please note that any pixelated images are the fault of my scanner, not of the stamps.\r\n\r\nMost of my stamps are from the 90&#39;s, and that means that they are discontinued. Some are from companies that are no longer in business. That means that these stamps are not the ones you commonly find in the stores these days. Your chance of finding something &quot;different&quot; in my stash is pretty good.\r\n\r\nThis stamp measures about 3\\\\/4&quot; X 2.25&quot;, and was made by Stampart Jubilee.\r\n\r\nRegarding domestic shipping: With the new postal rates, it’s very hard to predict shipping costs, because it depends upon the weight of the stamps you buy. I generally ship priority, and I will ship up to 1 lb of stamps for $6. Your shipping cost will never exceed $9.15 per box, in any case, because I will use flat rate boxes to ship large numbers.\r\n\r\n*IF* you prefer shipping other than priority, please let me know BEFORE you pay, and I will calculate your exact shipping cost. Be certain to include your zip code.\r\n\r\n*****Also, please contact me BEFORE paying, for actual shipping costs outside the US. I have recently found that international shipping costs have increased a LOT, since our new postal rates started in May. First class is the cheapest rate offered now, and 4 lbs is the limit for first class. Anything over that weight must travel Priority, and that *STARTS* at $36.	1280338770000	1290920400000	1195346878000	1280338770000	4.0	USD	1	supplies.commercial.rubber.stamp.atlanta.hotlanta.georgia.south.southern.city.military_brats	wood.rubber	5183859	null	1	14235033	1280338770000	1.28033882E9	26	67	f

Thai Hilltribe silver.\r\n\r\nIn ancient times, agate was highly valued as a talisman or amulet. It was said to quench thirst and protect from fever. Persian magicians used agate to divert storms. Some believe agate renders the wearer invisible, and due to its strength and durability, it is used for making ornaments or for astrological purposes. Agate is a cooling stone and is said to cure insomnia, protect against danger, promote strength and healing, and ensure a healthy life. \r\n\r\nThai Hill Tribes Silver: Made using centuries-old, traditional methods in distinctive Hill Tribes styling.

Then the design is painted usine Fiber Reactive Dye\\\\/Paint to give those bold colors.\r\nNext the design is covered with wax and placed in a dye bath.\r\n\r\nAfter the garment has been submerged for at least an hour it is time to rinse and boil out the wax. This sometimes shrinks the garment which is why I recommened going a size up.\r\n\r\nI use Eco Friendly soap when washing the clothing.\r\nBatiking has many steps to it and we strive to make each one as conciously as we can. The wax is local Beeswax from our Co-Op,Salt supplied by Local Bulk store, and Urea from local Feed Store. The AA shirts are American Made, we carry Organic Tees and other tees which we can pick up locally, the boxes are re-used, and we re-use some of the wax again and again.\r\nWe hope you enjoy our Batiks! \r\n\r\n***CAN SPECIAL ORDER THIS DESIGN IN ANY SIZE ON WWW.TREETOWNBATIKS.COM***\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEach garment is designed in my home. The process begins with 100% pre-shrunk Cotton fabric.\r\nThrough the process of &#39;Batik&#39;, the fabrics are transformed into unique and colorful garments.\r\nImages are hand drawn in melted wax on the pieces of fabric, one at a time. As the wax cools, it hardens in to a resist. I then paint inside the design. After I cover the whole design with wax. In the dying process colors are unable to penetrate the resist patterns, however the cooled wax cracks allowing some of the dye to seep through. This creates my one of a kind designs. All of the dyes are Proactive dyes. Will not bleed or fade.\r\nAfter I dye the material, I boil it in soap and water to remove the wax, and further set the dye. I boil each garment twice. After a final wash, the shirts are then dried.\r\n\r\nYou may also visit me at www.treetownbatiks.com to order a different size.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n	1268795483000	1279336283000	1195491573000	1268795483000	27.5	USD	1	clothing.girl.shirt.tshirt.lotus.om.batik.tiedye.blouse	wax.dye.paint	6367450	null	1	14319586	1268795483000	1.26879552E9	30	54	f

8054589	sold_out	5201297	Midnight Blue Pietersite Wire Wrapped Pendant	Aaah, the colour of midnight, and perfect for after-dark wear!  This pendant features a cabochon of blue Chinese Pietersite, understated and classy.\r\n\r\nBlue is the rarest colour in Pietersite.  The brecciated appearance has been formed by the folding and fracturing of the earth&#39;s geologic processes.  The finished product creates multiple colours, hues and a superb chatoyancy (the bright and subtly changing shimmer of color that moves along the surface of a gemstone as it is viewed from varying angles).\r\n\r\nI&#39;ve wrapped this pendant in a classic style with 14K gold-filled wire. The pendant measures 2.4 inches (6cm) from the top of the bail, and is .8 inches (2cm) at its widest point. The bail is large enough to accommodate most chains and chokers.\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------\r\nI love creating one-of-a-kind artisan jewellery in one of the most ancient forms of jewellery-making – WIRE-WRAPPING! \r\nWire-wrapping requires no soldering or chemicals, only a few tools and a will to create! This means that jewellery designed with wire-wrapping can only be created by hand, and is absolutely GUARANTEED to be unique! And designs – well that is only limited by your imagination – infinite possibilities! \r\nI only use precious metals in my creations – pure sterling silver or 14K gold-filled. And as the stones used in my creations are often quite delicate, I hand-buff and polish every piece to ensure that it comes out to you bright and shiny and new – guaranteed to catch the eye!\r\n\r\nSo if you enjoy having people compliment you on your unusual jewellery, and if you quite enjoy the smug feeling that no-one else will EVER be wearing the same jewellery piece as you are – then you’ve come to the right place!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n	1248650436000	1259277636000	1195998301000	1248699142000	60.0	USD	1	jewelry.pendant.necklace.semiprecious.pietersite.blue.midnight.royal.velvet.gold.dust.jett.australia.wire_wrapped	pietersite.stone.cabochon.wire.gold.filled	5865788	null	1	14632402	1248699142000	1.24869914E9	9	46	f

Ears, hands and tail fin have needle stitched details.  Needle sculpting defines the breast area.  The face is made of various shades of cotton\\\\/cotton blend fabrics and the body is fashioned of stretchy glitter\\\\/glitz fabrics in various colors and textures.  She holds a sea shell full of beads and yarn &quot;sea weeds&quot;.  Her hair is various types and colors of yarn.  Hair, beads, yarn and hands are hot glued.

8892489	expired	5516788	Wanda the magical, whimsical garden mermaid goddess of hidden bubble land, a wonderful magic bubble wand, perfect unique gift 	WELCOME!! I’d like to introduce you to Wanda. She is a beautiful, funtastical, bubble making mermaid that would love to live in your garden!. This garden goddess really loves making bubbles! I must tell you Wanda&#39;s little secret! She just comes apart (some would say she loses her head!!) when there are bubbles to be made.  Actually that is exactly what Wanda was created to do.  Her head separates from her body (she doesn’t mind, I promise!) and it becomes a bubble wand.  Wanda will make a wonderful friend and perfect unique gift for that wild and whimsical goddess in your life.\r\nWanda is guaranteed to make many bubbles and even more smiles!\r\n\r\n~Making bubbles every day keeps the grouchies away!~\r\n\r\nA few interesting facts about Wanda:\r\nWanda is made up of 100% copper and copper wire. \r\nHer body is a brushed texture. \r\nHer tail, which actually moves from side to side, is a lustrous gold to teal-blue. \r\nWanda is (from head to tailfin) 14 inches tall.\r\nWanda’s head (the bubble wand) is 8 ½ inches long and just under 4 inches wide.\r\nThe wire that holds Wanda up is 30 inches long.\r\nAfter pushing the wire into the ground, Wanda will be about 2 ½ feet tall.\r\nWanda comes apart and totals three pieces: Head, body, wire (goes into the ground and holds her up)\r\nBecause Wanda is made with real copper she will not rust. However, copper will tarnish naturally. If you would like Wanda to stay nice and shiny simply give her a bath in a mixture of lemon juice and salt every once in a while. Careful with her tail, she does not like to get the lemon juice in her scales :)\r\n\r\nThanks for looking!
